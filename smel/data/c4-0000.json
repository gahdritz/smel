It has become a byword for finding what you need online.\nThey\u2019ve also got tools to support nonprofit cultural organisations. Google for Nonprofits was set up expressly to give charitable groups free access to Google\u2019s premium services. In practice, that means a similar suite of tools to the one Google offers businesses, with some added extras for nonprofits.\nIn terms of potential impact, Google Ad Grants is the real star here. If you qualify for Google for Nonprofits, you qualify for a staggering $10,000-worth of pay-per-click advertising every month. That means you\u2019ll get free text ads for your organisation on Google Search, building awareness and boosting income. While you\u2019ll need to understand Google AdWords to get the most of it, the potential is colossal.\nG Suite for Nonprofits is the other flagship tool, giving charities access to business-grade Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs and more. While you may already be familiar with many of the personal versions of these solutions, G Suite for Nonprofits is effectively a professional version of these, giving your organisation personalised email addresses, more mailbox space and 24/7 support online or by phone.\nThere\u2019s also Google One Today and Google Earth Outreach, which may well be relevant to your work \u2013 see the full list of Google for Nonprofits services to see what you could tap into. In Scotland, you\u2019ll need to be registered with tt-exchange to take advantage of the Google for Nonprofits offer. We profiled the Technology Trust and their tools previously, check out that post to get started.\nPlus!

Kim Reynolds called a Statehouse news conference to announce that Iowa was withdrawing its \"stopgap\" proposal -- first made in June -- to stabilize the individual market in part by attracting healthy Iowans needed to temper rate increases.\n\"We were doing something no state had tried to do,\" Ommen said. The health law popularly known as Obamacare \"has caused our market here in Iowa to collapse, and unfortunately now its inflexibility is preventing us from picking ourselves up and making the adjustments that are needed in order to attract healthy people back in.\"\nOmmen said Iowa offered an innovative approach, but Reynolds said Obamacare provisions proved too inflexible to overcome.\n\"I'm extremely disappointed,\" said Reynolds, who added that Trump administration officials gave Iowa a fair hearing.\n\"It came down to the law. As it's written, it just does not afford the flexibility that we need to be creative,\" she said. \"The bottom line is we need Congress to do their job. They need to act and they need to act sooner rather than later.\"\nIn a statement, U.S. Sen, Chuck Grassley joined his fellow Republican in asking for Congress to try again.\n\"As written, the law hamstrings the administration's ability to help Iowa,\" Grassley said. \"I hope Congress will act soon to repeal and replace this unworkable and unaffordable law.\"\nHowever, the news also comes about two weeks after the Washington Post reported that President Donald Trump personally called the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services in August to direct that Iowa's application be denied, as one of several actions he has taken to unravel the health insurance law.\nIowa's withdrawal comes only a week before this year's enrollment period opens Nov. 1 and despite the state insurance division's warning that without the plan, 22,000 Iowans will drop out of the market.\nOmmen said the Trump administration informed the state last week it was still \"several weeks\" away from determining how much federal funding the state might receive, a key part of the proposal.\nMonday's announcement means that Minnesota-based Medica will be the only statewide insurer in the Affordable Care Act marketplace in Iowa for 2018.\nMedica said its premium rates would go up an average of 57 percent in 2018, partly because Trump also has ended cost-sharing subsidies to the insurance companies that held rates down.\nState officials had complained that large of an increase would significantly hurt people who don't buy on the marketplace or don't qualify for federal tax credits.\n\"We certainly understand the state's desire to improve the individual market in Iowa, and we are appreciative of being a part of those discussions,\" said Larry Bussey, Medica's communications director. \"While this is not the preferred outcome for the state of Iowa, we want consumers to know that Medica is ready.\"\nBussey said consumers who previously purchased coverage through healthcare.gov will receive information from the government and Medica over the next week explaining options.\n\"We strongly encourage consumers to see if they qualify for a premium subsidy\" that could \"dramatically reduce\" costs for those found to be eligible, he said.\nReynolds said the lack of the waiver will hit farmers, self-employed Iowans, early retirees and others who rely on individual insurance coverage. She said the state continues to explore short-term options to help Iowans get some type of affordable health-insurance coverage, but most require waivers.\nNewly installed state Senate Democratic Leader Janet Petersen of Des Moines said Democrats are ready to work with Reynolds to find a workable, bipartisan solution. But, so far, she said, Republicans \"have done everything possible to undermine Obamacare.\"\nBut Republican Party of Iowa spokesman Carlos Cruz said the blame falls to the failure of Obamacare -- and he applauded Reynolds and Ommen for trying.\nState Sen. David Johnson, an Ocheyedan independent, said the situation calls for presidential leadership but the current approach appears to be to allow Obamacare to fail in hopes the GOP-led Congress will replace it.\n\"I don't believe that's a winning strategy -- that failure leads to success,\" Johnson said.", "version": "v0"}

This technique is often used with children in their families. When done properly, it makes it possible for individuals with complex needs to live in their families and communities.\nThis term was originally created in the 1980s. Over the years, the definition has changed slightly. It originally described an approach to individualized care planning. It is an intensive management and planning process, but it is not a true treatment technique. Instead, Wraparound is a way to structure a creative planning process that is customized to the individual\u2019s unique needs. It is more holistic than normal plans because it incorporates what the family and siblings need as well.\nThe core principles of this type of planning focuses on voice and choice. It wants to provide all members of the family to provide their perspectives on the activities, services and support options.\nIn 2004, the National Wraparound Initiative was started to better describe how the model works. Basically, the process focuses on four key phases. These include engagement and team preparation, transition, initial plan development and implementation. As the process begins, all of the people relevant to the child\u2019s life are incorporated into the discussion. This includes family members, service providers, agency representatives and members of the social support network for the family. They collaborate to create, implement and monitor the plan.\nThe key components of this program start with listening carefully to the client and their support system. Then, they identify the difference the individualized goals for the clients based on their needs. They include interventions that focus on the client\u2019s needs and identify different ways to handle crisis situations.\nIn the first phase of the Wraparound process, the facilitator generally works with the teacher, family and student. They have an initial conversation about the family\u2019s story as they build a relationship. During the engagement phase, the facilitator builds a trusting relationship and explains what the family can expect. They also work to gather information about the team members.\nDuring the initial plan development, the facilitator works to create baseline data about the strengths and needs for the child. Then, they share this data with the team. Different needs are prioritized and they create an action plan. The team works together to brainstorm strategies.\nIn the ongoing plan implementation phase, the facilitator continues to monitor the data. This information is used to review the initial plan and make necessary revisions. A meeting schedule is maintained so that the results can be reviewed. If things are not working, the action plan is revised.\nIn the transition phase, the team needs fewer regular meetings. Instead, the goal is to review and celebrate accomplishments. A transition plan is created to provide ongoing support.\nWhen used properly, the Wraparound framework can help children gain holistic support. Everyone works as a team to achieve a progress. With a Wraparound plan, multiple life domains and individual needs can be addressed at once.", "version": "v0"}

Well, they fixed that a long time ago. But newer borwsers including both Firefox and Google Chrome are using the Google database of malware sites to pop up warning messages if you try to go to a site that contains or links to malware. What that means to you is that if you provide or link to malware your visitors will get a very ugly and nasty message about hwo unsafe and dangerous your web site is. Most visitors will not know how to by pass this warning, and even fewer will be willing to.\nMalware is not virus. It has nothing to do with viruses, other then both are bad. Malware is just bad software. Most of the time when talking about websites, it\u2019s a cookie that is left behind with certain permissions, or an image that is loaded from a traffic monitoring server that uses that data for less then legal means. Most of the Malware is installed by the site owner or developer without ever intending to do so.\nFor end consumer websites (where the visitor is doing the buying or reading), getting this message will stop most of the traffic to your site resulting in fewer sales, or less income from ads. For SAAS websites it means that all your clients will have their traffic blocked, and they will be very angry with you, and will likely no longer be your customers. The same goes for link list providers and other directory services.\nPrevention is obviously the best thing to do in this case. It is however very tricky and easy at the same time.\nFirst make sure that you only link to quality sites with no malware on them. You can only be dinged if you link to malware sites, not if they link to you. Make sure before you include links to any site you check it thoroughly. For forums, blogs, and other consumer drive content sites, I recommend disabling automatically linking all URLS. This means the users can still type in URLs but that visitors have to copy and paste the URL into their browsers. This separation keeps you from getting dinged by a user pasting in a malware site link.\nSecond avoid including anything from a less-then-quality source that says things like \u201cpast this code on your page\u201d. That is the number one way to get on the Malware list. A lot of these services come across are traffic watchers, Traffic boosters, or such. Some come across as totally legitimate services like tickers, and contact forms. The best advise I can give here is \u201cjust don\u2019t\u201d. Of course sometimes it\u2019s needed for site functionality, and that\u2019s ok, just make sure you know where it is coming from (i.e. Icontact forms are ok because Icontact is a known provider) and make sure that you keep a list of when you have made this exception so that they can be easily removed if need be.\nOk, so something happened, a user posted a link, you included a counter you shouldn\u2019t have, that last image you posted was actually hosted by someone who got dinged, or in most cases, a site you have been using for years just got added to the malware list for some reason. Well, removing your self from the list is very simple. It involves making a google account, verifying you own the domain, removing the offending content, certifying that you did so, then waiting about 3 days. It is a very simple thing to do, and if your already using Google analytics, your half way there. I can help with this if need be, or most other developers can too. Removing the offending content is the hardest part, the rest is basically just paper work. Again the best method is prevention.", "version": "v0"}

The highlight of the tour being a live broadcast on the BBC.\nCape Town music. Today there's this catch phrase, 'the Goema sound', it's like a cross between the traditional langarm and the Cape Town carnival sound; it's a mix of that, a perfect blend. I can rightly say I'm a pioneer of putting the Goema sound together. It all happened during the struggle, with Basil, Robbie and myself; I like all sorts of music, but I always loved who I am and that's our power, the Goema sound.\"\nwas where I got the song and the name of the song, sitting there and honouring my ancestors.\"\nHis communal roots are evident in the album's title. A \"kou kou wa\", is a mobile shop selling food and sweets that was given its nickname back in the day when the Cape townships were still being built. If you hear the kou kou wa you can be sure you're not going to go hungry that day.\nHis diverse music influences are particularly evident on a new track called Tatiyane. \"It's a Gospel-inspired African song.\" Tatiyane means 'take away' in Xhosa, as in \"take away the pain and bring on the love - The church has a lot to do with who I am.\" And aside from music, Dyers's creativity extends to writing plays and poems.\nDespite all these different influences, the new album is inspired by Cape Town's special sound and people. He thinks the place has a vibe that isn't found anywhere else in the world. If you don't get what that means then Errol Dyers suggests that you \"listen to the album and you'll see\".", "version": "v0"}

The electrospray ionization (ESI) technique is used for the transfer of (multi-)metallic complexes and organic molecules from solution into the gas phase. The subsequent storage of molecular ions in ion traps allows for a variety of spectroscopic methods in order to investigate the intrinsic properties of the isolated species void of solvent, crystal lattice, bulk or supporting surface effects. The magnetic properties of metal complexes are elucidated by gas phase X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) spectroscopy. The element selective technique in combination with sum rule analysis allows for a separate determination of spin and orbital magnetic moments at different metal centers. Structural investigations on isolated molecular ions in terms of coordination sphere, binding motifs and hydrogen bonds are conducted using infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy. A resonant two color IRMPD technique serves to increase fragmentation yields, overcome dissociation bottlenecks and reveal otherwise dark bands. Comparison of experimental IRMPD spectra with calculated harmonic absorption spectra by density functional theory (DFT) provides structural assignments for a profound understanding of intra- and intermolecular interactions.", "version": "v0"}

We have had people with a range of chronic health conditions participate so far and their feedback has been very encouraging. Although the Course is hard work, our overall findings are that more than 90% report the course is worth their time and that they'd recommend it to others. Most participants are also reporting significant improvements in their emotional wellbeing and any symptoms of stress, anxiety, worry, low mood and depression.\nWhen is the Next Course Being Offered?\nWe are now in the process of revising the Chronic Conditions Course based on feedback from 100s of participants. We expect to be offering the course again in the second half of 2019.\nIf you are interested in participating in our next Courses, please click on the 'Register Now!' button below and follow the prompts.\nOf course, if you have any questions about the Course please feel free to contact us, click HERE.", "version": "v0"}

The latter has just announced he is dying from incurable cancer. First, let's take a look at the founder of Heritage Foundation and his affiliations. Mr. Weyrich wielded such power, and had so many organizations, that I'm only able to skim the surface of his many involvements.\nPlease understand that I'm writing this series to make people aware that all those great sounding rightwing groups have hidden agendas and affiliations with the Communist left and the shadow government of the CFR. We must know our enemies. In doing so, we can counter their efforts with the truth.\nPaul M. Weyrich was born in 1942 and died in 2008. He was allegedly an American religious conservative and figurehead of the New Right. The latter has nothing to do with old-right Constitutional conservatives. The New Right is made up of neo-con Trotskyites and corporate fascists. They masquerade as \"moderate\" Republicans. See Part 3 of this series.\nWeyrich was the Grand Poobah of the Council for National Policy. He was on the CNP Board of Governors in 1982 and 1996, and was the CNP Secretary-Treasurer as well as being on the Executive Committee in 1984-1985 and 1988. The Executive Committee decides who can become a member, and who can be an invited guest. He co-founded the conservative think tanks, the Heritage Foundation, the Free Congress Foundation, and the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). He coined the term \"Moral Majority\", the name of the political action group Moral Majority that he co-founded in 1979 with fellow CNP charter member, Jerry Falwell.\nAs major founder of the Heritage Foundation, Paul Weyrich served as the first president in 1973-1974. Funding came from Joseph Coors, and Richard Mellon Scaife. Here is a list of Heritage's top funders today, along with their board of trustees. Note that Carthage Foundation, Sarah Scaife Foundation, and Scaife Family Foundation are all Richard Mellon Scaife foundations. Here is Weyrich's own story of how he and Joe Coors worked together to create Heritage Foundation.\nIn 1971, Joseph Coors along with Jack Wilson and Paul Weyrich, founded Analysis and Research Inc., to establish a political research entity, that being Heritage Foundation. CNP member, Joe Coors donated the first-year Heritage budget of $250,000 for 1973 from the coffers of the Coors Corporation, and for the next two years gave $200,000. He then pledged $15,000 per month, but eventually gave more. Coors and Weyrich set up the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress, which evolved into the Free Congress Foundation, to carry out political activities, and the Heritage Foundation as a tax exempt educational research entity.\nThe Coors company provided Heritage Foundation with $20,000 per month during the foundation's first year. Weyrich was Heritage president until February 28, 1974. The Free Congress Foundation Board of Directors included Weyrich who was an ardent supporter of the Society for the Protection of Tradition, Family and Property (more on them later) and Charles Moser, an editorial adviser to a publication that praises the Nazi Waffen SS.\nWeyrich, who for years represented the ongoing political interests of the Coors family in Washington, DC, sponsored and worked closely with convicted Austrian Nazi collaborator, Laszlo Pasztor, a Hungarian-American who was employed at Free Congress Foundation, the political arm of Heritage Foundation. Pasztor's Coalitions of the Americas was housed as a subsidiary of the Free Congress Foundation. The Coors and Scaife-funded Heritage Foundation co-sponsored a 1989 forum with a pro-Nazi group, the Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations.\n\u201cIn addition to homegrown agitators who dredged up anti-Semitic motifs that harkened back to the 1930s, some countries had to contend with groups that were led or supported by pro-fascist exiles who repatriated from the West where they had carried on as vocal anti-Communists during the Cold War, often with CIA support. The Free Congress Foundation, founded by American far right strategist Paul Weyrich, became active in eastern European politics after the Cold War. Figuring prominently in this effort was Weyrich\u2019s right-hand man, Laszlo Pasztor, a former leader of the pro-Nazi Arrow Cross organization in Hungary, which had collaborated with Hitler\u2019s Reich. After serving two years in prison for his Arrow Cross activities, Pasztor found his way to the United States, where he was instrumental in establishing the ethnic-outreach arm of the Republican National Committee.\"\nThe Northern League merged newsletters with Britons Publishing Company, an anti-Semitic publisher and a major distributor of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. It was theosophist, and Russian occultist, Yuliana Glinka, who cooked up the Protocols, and she was the companion and coordinator for Madam Helena Blavatsky's Theosophical Society. [Link] All anti-Semitics, please refrain from writing to me.\nThe Policy Review was then published by the Hoover Institute whose members include Ed Meese, CFR Condi Rice, and NAFTA's Richard Allen. It was discontinued in 2013.\nPearson\u2019s racialist theories are still circulated worldwide by neo-Nazi and white supremacist organizations. Pearson was a recipient of white supremacist and pro-eugenics grants from Pioneer Fund to the tune of a million dollars. One of the funds' founders was former Senator Jesse Helms, 33rd degree mason, and Council for National Policy charter member.\nHuebeck goes on to say, \"There will be three main stages in the unfolding of this movement. The first stage will be devoted to the development of a highly motivated elite able to coordinate future activities. The second stage will be devoted to the development of institutions designed to make an impact on the wider elite and a relatively small minority of the masses. The third stage will involve changing the overall character of American popular culture.\nAnd just what are they changing it into?\nPaul Weyrich wrote an article in 1987 entitled, \"A Conservative's Lament.\" In it he stated, \"If we are going to be a serious nation, we need a serious system for selecting our leaders and advisors. We need some type of shadow government, in which leaders and top advisors can be identified and developed, and through which our politics can be better focused on policy choices. The world is a professional league, and we cannot win fielding amateur teams.\" What does he think the CFR is? Of course he loved the parliamentary form of government.\nIn Part 6, we'll continue looking at Heritage Foundation and their UN connections, NAFTA, and the Health Care mandate. Please remember that I'm simply skimming the surface of these people involved with the Council for National Policy. Throughout the rest of this series, Heritage Foundation is at the center of the Council for National Policy.\n", "version": "v0"}

Full of curves and bumps, the road is often sticky, sometimes steep. Undeterred by brambles, pertinacious, tenacious, onward ever onward. The trip has been occasionally wistful, more often memorably joyous.\nSo many selves, each left at a juncture as I leap across every stream!\nBut I wonder, would I know them, those different selves, if I met them all again?\nI\u2019d like to try. So I turn and look back, just over my shoulder.\nThe sun outside is flaming hot, the water in the round blue pool is icy cool. Somewhere a barbecue hisses and sizzles. The grown up talk hums and buzzes in my ears. The ladies\u2019 dresses swish and brush at the top of my head. My mother lifts me away then gently puts me down in the water. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bathtub,\u201d she whispers, \u201cthis is is different. It\u2019s a pool.\u201d The ladies are there with their Cherries in the Snow lipstick, with their pointy Cutex red fingernails. with the voluminous skirts of their summer dresses ballooning over me like so many parachutes. So fancy. I so want to do the right thing. So very delicately I place my hands flat, over \u2014 but not in \u2014 the water. This has to be the right thing to do.\nArms thrust into jackets, feet crammed into boots, hats askew on heads, the bell brrrrrriiiinnngs and we burst through the door like a churning river busting open a dam! The air is crisp and sharp and we puff out our breaths pretending we are smoking Lucky Strikes or Pall Malls. Some run to the monkey bars, others to the swings. But the best place is the hardtop, smooth and glistening, a sheer, slippery sheen of ice. We run as fast as we can and slide to the end, balancing on our buckled rubber boots, over and over. But then, suddenly, my toe is caught and I am upended. I wake flattened on the ice, a lump forming on the back of my head. I am dizzy and it hurts so much. Two of my classmates help me into the nurse\u2019s office. I am curtly told to lie down. But when the nurse\u2019s back is turned I jump up and weave away, back down the hallway back to the blacktop. \u201cStop, stop, stop! I am crying at everyone. \u201cPlease stop before you get hurt too!\u201d But they won\u2019t! They don\u2019t!\nIf truth be told I was far more suited to lashing scenery together, deftly whipping the ropes to hold the flats upright, than actually stepping out on stage. But oh, \u201cthe roar of the greasepaint, the smell of the crowd!\u201d With the dawn of Spring, I was, we all were, swept overboard by our longed for performances of HMS Pinafore, me as one of the multitude of pasteled and bonneted chorus girls. But on opening night, instead of the required mild quaver in response to \u201cHark! Stay your hand! She loves you!\u201d I wrapped my entire body around my sailor partner in a very non-19th century mode of terror. The audience loved it. My director, however, did not.\nThis is how it worked. Phones ring, orders taken, tiny shreds of paper pushed down the line. The dough tossed casually in the air, caught and stretched onto a tray. Sauced by one and cheesed by another, then shoved over to me, the Toppings Queen. Mushrooms, onions, peppers, sprayed like confetti from my hands. Pepperoni dealt like blackjack. Sausage is the worst, so sticky that I have to dunk my hands in the olives to be able to fling bits onto the pies. The pizza is then shoved into the patented, conveyer belt oven to be out in precisely twelve minutes, then boxed and thrust into the hands of the delivery boy who then has to drive like combination of Mario Andretti and AJ Foyt to have the door to door delivery done within the requisite thirty minutes. The clatter and the tumult all night long, hour after hour pie after pie. Until finally closing time, 2:00 am. Floured, sauced and redolent of raw sausage, I step out into the empty parking lot. The velvet sky is flung full of stars. And I am all alone.\nHaving punched and feinted my way down to this trim fighting weight, glorying in the fact that at last my closet is arrayed only with stylish clothes that fit, rather than dreamed for outfits that were simply yearned for, I am certain I can manage this new challenge with aplomb. We sit together in the waiting room, glowing with the knowledge that we belong here. The low tables are strewn with magazines, each one more baffling and humbling than the next: American Baby, Today\u2019s Parent, Natural Mother. as well as several rumpled copies of What to Expect When You Are Expecting. I nervously pick up a magazine and riffle the pages and open to photo of an absurdly tranquil mother double breastfeeding. I blanch.\nWhen I am called in to the office my practitioner performs a routine sonogram all the while keeping up his usual stand up comedy routine (he\u2019s really quite good). \u201cRemember,\u201d he says grinning widely, \u201cif it\u2019s a boy you have to name him Austin after me!\u201d He stares casually at the screen but then suddenly stops and squints hard. His practiced patter fades away. His mouth hardens to a line. Firmly he presses a button and quietly asks the nurse to get my husband.\nWhen I ask what\u2019s wrong, something must be wrong, would he please tell me what\u2019s wrong he doesn\u2019t answer. Instead, when my husband comes into the room he simply points at the screen. And to my husband he asks, \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d On the blurry screen, my husband points to a trembling bubble. And then another.\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said my practitioner. And if they boys you should name them both Austin.\nHe is the idea man and of course this was his idea too. Once a week, every week he forgoes he happy chaos of the lunchroom, denies himself the ebullient tornado of recess where he is usually the eye of the storm. Signed out at the office, we proceed to Balducci\u2019s where he will choose an absurd array of sushi or thickly layered sandwiches wrapped carefully in butcher paper. He\u2019ll find a cupcake for dessert and always snag a caramel-filled chocolate bar to save for later.\nThe third of three sons, he is sometimes referred to wryly as \u201cthe happy child of benevolent neglect.\u201d But in fact he is, and has always been the man in charge of all. Somehow he knows how I miss his brothers, relegated as they are to the rigors middle school. We sit and eat our lunch together in the backseat of the car, the engine running so we can play Tom and Jerry or Rugrats cartoons on the tiny video screen. I always hate to send him back to school. But I always do.\nWho are they exactly, these sometimes quirky, often befuddled, flawed but generally well-meaning souls? Did I leave them all behind or did any of them cling to me for the march ever forward? All of these earlier selves are both so achingly familiar and yet curiously distant. But even so, no matter what, my arms reach out to each of them, my former selves, in kindness, to warm them, to embrace them still and bring them with me as we move forward.", "version": "v0"}

The run started at 6 bells and went like clockwork arriving in dover before 1pm and the offer of a free earlier ferry was not turned down.\nThe campsite is a revisit so no surprises were in store and it looked as beautiful as ever the flowers and grassed areas are so well kept, with massive pitches. So well in fact we are going to look at them for another day.\nThis was a day that would start early, Paul had spotted the pool and they would be no stopping him until he had his way, a lovely pool all to ourselves most of the time.\nWe enjoyed ourselves so much that a 3rd night was added, we even packed unplugged and drove to the reception then..............turned round and went back. Another day by the pool and a bike ride to the spot the Eurostar at 300kph (true train spotters now). This option appealed more then driving 230miles in the heat to Troyes.\nAn early start was in order to reach Troyes and get on first come first served campsite, sadly I had discovered a lovely bar in the vilage center last night which sold a unknown light beer that tasted fantastic and buckled my knees. So the early start was a right struggle.\nNo problem getting here autoroute for 200 miles (at a cost of 38&\u20ac;, I hate paying tolls) and pitched on camping municipal for 1pm. which was surprising as we had to pass a Mac Arthur Glen shopping outlet a mile from the site. Karen stared and stared but we sailed right on by. Paul was horrified when he spotted the new swimming pool empty, this would enable Karen to get into town for retail therapy.\nOkay all today was about was to reach Annecy. 270 miles south about 240 on the autoroute at a cost of 47\u20ac. Last time I took 2 days to cover the same ground and stayed off the autoroute, more picturesque cheaper but at the cost of a day which I wanted to spend elsewhere.\nAnnecy campsite would not score well with Paul, it lacked a little on kids facilities but being only 0.6mile to town, this is always the price you pay for location.\nTonight we would be reminded of home as it poured down, to wet to even sit under the awning, it lasted only an hour or so and the lightening was a marvel to watch (if not scared).\nTuesday was spent wondering around the old town, photo after photo and preparing for an early start on the Leffe followed by Moules and fries the best this side of North Shields.\nGood idea at the time early start required to reach next campsite, as they would only reserve a pitch until 12 noon. Now we had an idea that we wanted to do a bike ride on the shores of Lake Annecy, so get up at 7 bells and do it. I dragged them from their beds relocated the motorhome and set off for 8am ish.\nThe lake side is a delight and a fantastic bike track exists, the views are fantastic, the mountains on the opposite side of the lake would also be our next destination. We were only moving 20 miles to Le Grand Bornand, a small picturesque village with a full rated resort campsite.\nThe campsite was excellent well placed only 200m from town with a wide selection of Bars and restaurants. However these would have to wait for Paul to exhaust himself in the pool ( a full adventure type of play area).\nWednesday would see us do our first proper walk in the alps to a height of 1450mto Le Croix. The weather was fantastic at 28c it was maybe a little hot for Paul. A cable car was used for the decent.\nMont Blanc !!! this is as close as I will get.\nThis is the end of the tourist trail, after here it's for real.\nViews as we walked away from the mid cable car station to reach the train at the glazier Mer de Glace.\n4.5 miles of the best walking one could wish for, It also included a top of 2202m.\nThe walk is referred to as the Plan de l'Aiguille to Montenvers traverse.\nIt was a bind to leave Le Grand Bornand, and I am sure to return. The morning as spent on a bike ride discovering more advantages to return. We also got the opportunity to watch the the para gliders landing.\nThe route taking to Chamonix Mont Blanc was on the advise of the campsite, high and twisty and it was good in a motor home so I would love to try it on my bike. The route took us through La Cluzaz over the Col des Arivas (fantastic spot) then join the main road at Flumet, passed a good site at Praz-S-Arly, continuing by many beautiful towns and villages and finally reaching one of my all time favorites at Chamonix.\nThankfully the owner had kept us a spot, which was just as well as the full sign greeted us at the gate. If you picked good sites just on views this would not be bettered, however it is also close to town and the facilities including free WiFi are of a very high standard No sooner had we arrived that we decided to stop one more night. If fact by the last day we had added more to the total and decided on a lazy day in Chamonix.\nTime to get a 2 day pass for the lifts and do some high altitude exploring, first day to Aiguille du Midi 3842m and traverse to Montenvers and the second day to walk the other side of the valley between Gares De Planpraz to Chalet de la Flegere cable car stations. also the opportunity to travel in 2 more lifts to admire the views from the tops.\nThe weather has been fantastic at 24c at 6pm in Chamonix is about enough for me.\nThe high spot on the left is the top of the cable car and the one on the right is Mont Blanc...Den told me it was flat between the two and looked a nice walk??\ngood walking today, traverse between cable car stations at approx 2000m.\nGares De Planpraz to Chalet de la Flegere.\nThe view of the cable car we had been on the day before, now on fire. A helicopter worked for the rest of the day bringing it under control.\nOur lazy day in Chamonix got us to look around bars and the like from which we got the odd good shot of a church among other things.\nWorth it for the views and this was only on the train to Murren cable car station.\nChamonix will be revisited, however it was time to up anchor and move on. Decided on the quick route to Lauterbrunnen and make use of the good weather rather than the good roads. Well this would not go quite to plan as the front nearside brake decided to start and make horrible noises. It turned out to be a broken pad, which took 4 hours to source and change. So the idea of an early beer in the sun never happened.\nEventually getting pitched for 8pm on a busy Lauterbrunnen site just in time to watch the sun going down was as good as it gets today.\nBig time tourists would started in earnest today, as we took the decision to visit the Schilthorn revolving restaurant at 10,000 ft once used in the James Bond 007 movie \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\". I have to say it was fantastic day out very smart and with a good restaurant with 360\u00b0 views over the space of about 30 min's.\nThe best shot of a base jumper we got ..these guys were unbelievable throwing themselves off the 500m rock face below.\nA 10 mile bike ride, a cable car to Gimmalwald to walk and back the same way was as good as it got today. The sun was shinning and the world was a beautiful place. Less touristy here and very nice for it.\nThe train journey was excellent and took us close, but eventually we had to alight and start to walk... This was the mission to walk along the north face of the Eiger, and this was Karen wanting her bit of the North Face.\nOkay another photo of the North Face, but it is nice.\nI think our route was nearly like this .....except horizontal along the bottom!\nOutside Hotel Victoria Interlaken, It's always nice to look.\nSunday morning and the cloud hung over the campsite but was clear above, eventually burned off but we were long gone above it all.\nWhat it is all about the view from my chair out side the motorhome on our last night. The wonderful Eiger.\nTime to move, it was raining and we wanted to look around Interlaken so it was decided to see the area from the other side of the valley at Grindlewald. A fantastic place, campsite has wonderful views of the Eiger and the town has shops. Also moving in motorhome is not a big problem. After a few showers on the Friday it was a shame to see damp clouds on Saturday and a planned day was put on hold to the Sunday.\nSunday was a different day fantastic, up early and on the bus before 9am to Grosse Shieidegg and a walk to First to try out the \"First Flyer\" a aerial runway that you get strapped into and travels at 50mph over 800m. Paul thought it was fantastic. Then it was back to base in the cable car. Next problem one day short equals two long drives to get home.\nThe drinking water fountain at the campsite, the constant flow of water keeps water cold. Campers use it to keep their beer cold. Somehow not sure if the honesty bit would work at home.\nIf you look slightly to the left of the view of the Eiger you can do this one....Bye bye campsite.\n7am Monday and it had to happen, 600 miles away in the back and beyond and you have got till 4pm tuesday to drag the bus fully laded back to Ijumden for the ferry home. My only thoughts are to ring the ferry company and put it back a week.\nProgress excellent and sited for 4pm, a good spot by the side of the Rhine accessed by a short car ferry ride. The town is excellent small enough to have a good wonder and large enough for choice. The meal in the \"Drosselgasse\" district was the best for a long time, even if Karen did spent twice as much on drink (fancy coffees) as she did food.........It was the last night.\nWhat can you say it was a boat home, okay it's better coming into the Tyne than into Dover. From a 8am start arrived after a lunch stop at 2.30pm. in the rain, as it happened we had some proper heavy rain on the way in and still covered ground in good time.\nConclusion... An excellent faultless holiday apart from one brake pad wish I had done 4 weeks so sad to be heading home.", "version": "v0"}

Okay, okay, it wasn't the plague, but boy was it a doozy of a respiratory infection that knocked me off my feet FOR SURE! I spent the first week of August fighting through a fever to teach summer camp to a troop of 5-9 year olds, trekking through a garden while attempting to sing and direct a show with no voice. YIKES. Needless to say, I went straight to bed as soon as I got home everyday and blogging did not happen.\nNow that I've had time to rest (and a doctor who finally said it was more than a summer cold!) I have my wits about me! I say it every month, but I'll say it again, WHERE DOES THE TIME GO?! My two months in Seattle come to a close today, and I head back for the homeland in the morning. The time here has been so sweet and refreshing, so different than I expected but still so good, and I'm more than a little bummed to leave it behind.\nI also have to say that writing out these goals have made me more than a little excited about the month of August! There are big things ahead y'all! I thrive on routine and I'll be back in the flow of school before we know it.\nAren't these campers the cutest?! During our pirates camp we had a mystery to solve!\n1. Read 5+ books. Check, check, and check: Where'd You Go, Bernadette, Lizzy & Jane, The Better Life, Alias Hook, and Passion & Purpose. I had hoped to read more but meeting the goal of 5 works for me. See my full library list HERE.\n2. Turn 24 and celebrate it well! Done deal. Twenty-four sounds so much older than twenty-three, but I hope to own it and have the best year yet! My campers made me a crown, I took the littles to see the Minions movie, and then went out for dinner and ice cream with friends from church. What a day!\n3. Co-host the #AnInspiredSeason series. Hoorah! So some of them didn't make it into blog posts, but I so loved following the hashtag and connecting with the gals involved.\n4. Money in the bank! Mhm! Not as much as I'd like, but hey, it's a start!\n5. Write my play analysis for Almost, Maine. We'll come back to this one.\n6. Be saturated in scripture and dedicate time to prayer. Hoping to continue the daily practice even as transition is up ahead. It makes such a difference!\n7. Get active! I went to dance class a few times, but according to my Fitbit doing choreography and running theatre camps act as \"active minutes.\" I'll take 'em!\n8. See good theatre! Check and check! I saw Wicked (for the 5th time) and As You Like It a few Sundays ago. Definitely good theatre.\n9. The Contentment Challenge. Progress has been made! I slipped up once or twice, but I can see/feel a definite change. Hopefully it will continue in the months to come.\nJuly disappeared before I had time to blink, so I'm not entirely upset that some of these goals weren't completed, and I'm rather impressed with the ones that were! Now for this month.\n1. Finish the Seattle season well. Today is my last day in The Emerald City, and I have to say this one may be checked off already! Last week was my final camp and even though I was under the weather it was a success, AND I made time for Lifegroup and friends! Plus Saturday was THE BEST as it included the TAYLOR SWIFT concert! So yes, #1 can be checked off already!\n2. Settle back in at OSU. It's back to Cowboy territory in a few days, and I'm eager to get settled in at my apartment, unpack, and take on the new semester.\n3. Start Almost, Maine with a bang! Y'all, I am SO excited for this show! It is full of beautiful (and sad) love stories, and I cannot wait to put together my creative team! I made my first purchase for the set (call me crazy for ordering 400 paint sticks... with more to come...) and have been doodling and writing for days.\n4. Continue the Contentment Challenge. YES. This has to happen. I've found that the less I spend on myself, the more I save and the more joy I have in gifting to others. I want to use my money wisely and honor my parents by how I spend (and save) this month. After my weekend splurge on TSwift, I'm ready to get back at it.\n5. Follow the Write the Word Journal. Have you seen these yet?? Lara Casey --you know she's my fave-- came out with these journals in which each day there's a space for a grateful list, a specific scripture to write out/draw/doodle/reflect on, and a full page for your heart's ramblings. I LOVE this form of scripture study! Speaking of gifting things from the goal above, I've already picked up a few to give away!\n6. Find a routine of getting active that WORKS. Notice I didn't put a specific number here, though I know how many days a week I'm shooting for. I hit my first 10,000 steps in a day for my Fitibit the other day and got SO EXCITED! I'm also hoping to limit my Netflix binging to one episode on the treadmill at the gym like I did last year. This go-around it's about finding something I can do and do consistently. We'll see how it goes.\n7. Clear the clutter + don't bring more in. This should be partnered with The Contentment Challenge. You know it's going to be a white knuckled drive past Home Goods on my way to school this week. Once I'm at OSU, the temptation is lessened, but that hardly keeps me from TJMaxx for long. BUT I will be victorious! I shouldn't have time to shop anyway ;) I want to go through what I have and get rid of the excess, while keeping the extras OUT.\n8. Blog + Instagram with intention NOT obsession. I'm addicted. That I can and will readily admit. This month I want to limit my time spent on Instagram; less *scrollscrollscroll* more intentional commenting and connecting with the people that matter to me. I am also THRILLED to announce that The Blog-tember Challenge is returning next month, so I want to prep my posts and be ready to go ahead of time. These things always roll around on my busiest months. Sheesh. Stay tuned for more details!\n9. Write the words He gives me. Along with blogging intentionally, I really want to press into prayer and scripture this month about the vision + purpose behind the blog, and explore some of the ideas I have had over the summer. But I want to write what the Lord wants me to write, doing it out of a place of being rooted in Him. I cannot wait to see where He takes me.\nAugust in a nutshell! Of course, I set all of these goals from a cozy coffee shop in Seattle, knowing full well that in the heat and the hurry of Oklahoma life things could TOTALLY change! Either way, I'm giving it a go!\nSo come on, August, let's do this. Now what about you?\nWhat do YOU want to make happen in August?\nOver at Moon Bitcoin you may claim free satoshis. 163 satoshi every 1 hour.\nIf you're looking for the best Bitcoin exchanger, then you should pick YoBit.", "version": "v0"}

The pride of life can be defined as anything that is \u201cof the world,\u201d meaning anything that leads to arrogance, ostentation, pride in self, presumption, and boasting. John makes it clear that anything that produces the pride of life comes from a love of the world and \u201cif anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him\u201d (1 John 2:15).\nThe first example of the temptation of the pride of life occurs in the Garden of Eden, where Eve was tempted by the serpent to disobey God and eat the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Eve perceived that the fruit was \u201cgood for food,\u201d \u201cpleasing to the eye,\u201d and \u201cdesirable for gaining wisdom\u201d (Genesis 3:6). She coveted the fruit in three ways. First, it was appealing to her appetite. This John refers to as the \u201clust of the flesh,\u201d the desire for that which satisfies any of the physical needs. The fruit was also pleasing or delightful to the eye, that which we see and desire to own or possess. Here is the \u201clust of the eyes\u201d John refers to. Finally, Eve somehow perceived that the fruit would make her wise, giving her a wisdom beyond her own. Part of Satan\u2019s lie was that eating the fruit would make her \u201clike God, knowing good and evil\u201d (Genesis 3:5).\nHere is the essence of the pride of life\u2014anything that exalts us above our station and offers the illusion of God-like qualities, wherein we boast in arrogance and worldly wisdom. Eve wanted to be like God in her knowledge, not content to live in a perfect world under His perfect grace and care for her. Satan tried these same three temptations on Christ during His 40 days in the wilderness (Matthew 4:1-11). He tempted Jesus with the lust of the flesh, bread for His hunger (vv. 2-3), the lust of the eyes, \u201call the kingdoms of the world with their splendor\u201d (vv. 8-9), and the pride of life, daring Him to cast Himself from the roof of the Temple in order to prove that He was the Messiah by an ostentatious display of power that was not in the will of God or His plan for the redemption of mankind (vv. 5-6). But Jesus, though He was \u201ctempted in every way, just as we are\u201d (Hebrews 4:15), resisted the devil and used the Word of God to ensure victory over him.\nChristians have always been, and will always be, lured by the same three temptations Eve and Jesus experienced. Satan doesn\u2019t change his methods; he doesn\u2019t have to because they continue to be successful. He tempts us with the lust of the flesh\u2014sexual gratification, gluttony, excessive alcohol consumption, and drugs, both legal and illegal, as well as the \u201cdeeds of the flesh\u201d about which Paul warned the Galatians, \u201csexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these\u201d (Galatians 5:19-21). He tempts us with the lust of the eyes\u2014the endless accumulation of \u201cstuff\u201d with which we fill our homes and garages and the insatiable desire for more, better, and newer possessions, which ensnares us and hardens our hearts to the things of God.\nBut perhaps his most evil temptation is the pride of life, the very sin that resulted in Satan\u2019s expulsion from heaven. He desired to be God, not to be a servant of God (Isaiah 14:12-15). The arrogant boasting which constitutes the pride of life motivates the other two lusts as it seeks to elevate itself above all others and fulfill all personal desires. It is the root cause of strife in families, churches, and nations. It exalts the self in direct contradiction to Jesus\u2019 statement that those who would follow Him must take up their cross (an instrument of death) and deny themselves. The pride of life stands in our way if we truly seek to be servants of God. It is the arrogance that separates us from others and limits our effectiveness in the kingdom. The pride of life \u201ccomes not from the Father, but from the world.\u201d And, as such, it is passing away with the world, but those who resist and overcome the temptation of the pride of life do the will of God, and \u201cthe man who does the will of God lives forever\u201d (1 John 2:17).", "version": "v0"}

They seem to be the new \u201cthing\u201d in learning. Zac over at Autodizactic is asking folks to help him think about MOOCs.\nI\u2019m not sure I even know what I think about MOOCs. Like Zac, I have signed up for MOOCs that I have then abandoned. It seems easy to both sign up for something that sounds interesting and that you can \u201cattend\u201d asynchronously. And then when it actually begins, it seems easy to let it go when life gets too busy or the tasks seem too arduous or mundane.\nI\u2019m currently signed up for a MOOC, led by people whose work I admire, focused on academic language development for English language learners\u2026and I\u2019m very interested in the subject matter. But already I\u2019m having trouble finding time to do the readings and complete the tasks assigned. I\u2019m pretty certain I won\u2019t be completing this MOOC.\nThis summer I had a completely different experience with the Connected Learning MOOC, clmooc, through the National Writing Project. And maybe the most important difference was in the way the acronym \u201cmooc\u201d was defined. Instead of being a \u201cMassive Open Online Course\u201d, the clmooc was defined as a Massive Open Online Collaboration.\nThere were still facilitators. And instead of assignments, there were make cycles. And participants were invited to add to make cycles, interpret them in their own ways, create totally new makes\u2026generally make the experience work for them.\nI found the experience exhilarating! I expected to \u201clurk\u201d around the edges of this experience. I knew when I signed up that this would be an extremely busy time for me. I was coordinating the SDAWP Summer Institute, starting a new grant-funded project, and supporting resource development for another project. But, because I found it relevant and because of the interaction with facilitators and participants, I was compelled to continue and experiment and learn and grow.\nDrawing on Connected Learning principles, my learning was interest-driven, peer supported, and openly networked. It was also production-centered, academically oriented, and had a shared purpose. And best of all, it was fun. Each effort made me interested in trying something else.\nI was both connected and learning\u2026and I have a badge to show for it!\nI have many reservations about MOOCs, especially those that are trying to be courses. I am all for open learning opportunities\u2013I\u2019m just not so sure that we need \u201ccourses,\u201d in the formal sense of the word, to achieve the goal of opening access to learning. And for me, the \u201ccourse-ness\u201d is the very quality that causes me to \u201cdrop out\u201d of MOOCs.\nSo, Zac (and anyone else who is thinking about MOOCs), I\u2019m not so sure my musing are helpful here\u2026but this thinking is helping me understand why the CLMOOC worked for me and these other MOOCs haven\u2019t.\nHere\u2019s my other one. It was awarded me by a peer for being a connected educator.\nWhat are you thinking about MOOCs\u2026and about badges?\nThis entry was posted in Connected Learning, thinking and tagged badges, clmooc, connected learning, connected learning principles, Massive Open Online Course, MOOC, National Writing Project, thinking on October 28, 2013 by kd0602.\nI too enjoyed the CLMOOC, but it is my only experience with MOOCs. I have an open mind to others, but I am not sure that a \u201ccourse\u201d is what I need or want right now. I never bothered to get my badge. Do you think it\u2019s too late?\nThanks for this post, Kim. It certainly resonated with me (and made me feel yet another wave of #clmooc happiness).\nTo me, MOOCs shouldn\u2019t be about plowing through assignments on a pre-determined schedule. They should be about learning at your own pace, in community, in a way that meets your unique needs.\nBut come to think of it, I think that\u2019s what all learning should be, I guess.", "version": "v0"}

In fact, attacks are increasing, said Aaron Call, the chief information security officer for Minnesota IT Services, which provides technology services to state executive agencies.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a massive uptick in these phishing incidents in the last several months,\u201d he said.\nWhile the DHS said its data breach happened June 28 and July 9, Minnesota IT Services didn\u2019t notify the department of the breach until Aug. 13. A DHS spokesperson said Friday that the agency has to report breaches no later than 60 days after it learns of an incident. Under a state law adopted several years ago, companies and government agencies are required to notify consumers of all data breaches.\nOn Friday, state Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka said in a statement that there was \u201cno excuse for a delay that long\u201d in notifying people. He wrote that the breach shows that government can\u2019t secure data. \u201cIt\u2019s a recipe for disaster,\u201d he added.\nCall said Gov. Mark Dayton recommended funding better technology to protect against phishing attacks, but the Legislature didn\u2019t fund it.\nCall said that, generally, attackers will look to monetize data or use e-mail addresses to send out more phishing attacks. Hackers could also try to reroute paychecks or target government systems to be disruptive.\n\u201cWe\u2019re never going to go back to the days of paper. It\u2019s always going to be out there,\u201d he said of personal data stored electronically. But, he added, Minnesota needs to invest more to ward off and respond to cyberattacks.\nLast December, a hacker targeted Explore Minnesota, the state\u2019s tourism agency, with phony news postings on Facebook. In April 2017, an e-mail \u201cspear phishing\u201d attack targeted the state Department of Education but was unsuccessful in getting data. And in June 2017, a hacker targeted the University of Minnesota\u2019s computer system but didn\u2019t access private data, following similar attacks against Minnesota State University Moorhead and other state government databases.\nDHS is preparing a report on the data breach. The report is expected by early to mid-November.", "version": "v0"}

Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control would receive discretionary funds of $770 million, up $45 million from 2017 levels.\n9. The budget cuts $451 million in health professional training and consolidates graduate medical education spending into a capped grant program.\n10.

Mom, Aunt Brenda, and I had sort of an impromptu day of quilting in my kitchen. We were joking that there are flash mobs, flash sales, and we could call this flash quilting.\nMom has had this beautiful cardinal fabric that she has been wanting to feature in a quilt, and she chose this pattern called Folklore by Villa Rosa Designs. She wanted to put the beautiful birds in the center of each square. Last Friday the three of us went to a local quilt show, and Aunt Brenda purchased this gorgeous snowflake batik fabric there. She decided she would frame each snowflake and add sashing and borders. I had purchased some fabric while on vacation at the Outer Banks back in 2013, so I dug it out of my stash and wanted to feature the lighthouse fabric in my blocks. However, I followed the block design of Folklore, but I didn't add borders or sashing. This morning we had our fabric cut and ready to sew.\nBelow are pictures of our individual blocks.\nWe made our blocks and pieced together our tops in one day! Now I have some longarming to do. Mom's is going to be quilted on the Innova with the Holly Berries pantograph, and I need to find some gold thread. Brenda said she may quilt hers on her Bernina at home with some snowflake designs she has. I plan on practicing some free motion designs on mine on the longarm machine.\nWe had a good day of quilting and chatting. I also love how our quilts are based on the same pattern but turned out so differently.\nThose are three pretty finishes for Finish It Up Friday at Crazy Mom Quilts. I hope you have a good weekend and are able to get some quilting done. Thanks for visiting!\nToday I finished this quilt, and I love it! It is made with all polka dot fabric and white background. Mom and I went to the Original Sewing and Quilt Expo back in August that was held in Monroeville, PA. There were some really spectacular quilts to see, but there was also a lot of shopping with the many vendors that were there. What I purchased that day was the Sweet Tooth quilting book and some jelly roll 2-1/2\" fabric strips that were all polka dot fabrics. This was a homemade collection that one of the vendors put together herself, and I thought her fabrics were really fun.\nAbove you can see the book. It is written to be used in conjunction with the Strip Tube Ruler. I found the ruler and also the additional blue polka dot fabric for the border at one of my favorite local shops, The Little Foot.\nThe pattern I used from the book is called \"Tube Cake.\" Below you can see some of the process. You sew the strips together to make pieces with 3 strips each. Then you put those face together and stitch them down both sides. This makes the tube of fabric. You line up the Strip Tube Ruler on the fabric tube just right and cut. When you open them up you get these lovely squares. It is a lot of fun to open those squares up and see the colors together. This is also a nice quick process to make the blocks needed for this quilt.\nI am also really pleased with the quilting design on this one. I tried another new pantograph called \"Tail Feathers.\" I thought it suited the playful polka dots just perfectly. I used white thread, and the backing on this quilt is white flannel. So if the photo looks a little fuzzy, that's because it is a little fuzzy! This is a really cozy quilt.\nBelow you can see the backing, and the quilting stands out pretty nicely. For the binding on this quilt I had enough portions of strips left over that I used them for a scrappy binding, and I love the result.\nI must admit I had a difficult time getting nice pictures today. It was late afternoon, and the lighting just wasn't right (both inside and outside), and the wind kept kicking up (just outside, thankfully :-).\nThat's my Friday finish. I would recommend the book and ruler, especially if you like quilts that go together fairly quickly and use precut fabric bundles. I hope to show you some other projects from the book in the future!\nI'll be linking up with Crazy Mom Quilts for Finish It Up Friday. Thanks for visiting!!\nWell, truly there is nothing like some Kate Spain fabric to brighten your day. I decided to try my hand at the Disappearing Hourglass block from the Missouri Star Quilt Company tutorial using a layer cake I have had in my stash for a while: Honey Honey. It's just beautiful.\nAunt Brenda thinks these \"disappearing\" kind of blocks are ridiculous - sew the squares together, cut it apart, sew together again, cut apart, repeat sewing and cutting some more - yet we do it anyway and love making them. So in this process you make some hourglass blocks like the 4 above, then you cut them apart just so, spin some things around, and sew them together again.\nAnd you get something that looks like this. I have just 38 more to go!\nIn those many, many boxes I mentioned earlier I have tons of scraps. A couple Saturdays ago Aunt Brenda and I took a little class at The Quilt Company on how to use the 8\" Creative Grids Curvy Log Cabin Trim Tool. I pulled out some pastel floral scraps and paired them up with a solid dark blue. I only made 3 blocks in the class, and they were sold out of templates at the store. My wonderful mom surprised me and ordered one online and had it mailed to me this week. Thanks, Mom!\nI also got the new 6\" Curvy Log Cabin template. I was playing around with it and thought I'd try some of my Christmas scraps. I made 4 blocks over the weekend. I need to make a lot more, but you can see there are so many ways to arrange the blocks to make different patterns. This is so much fun to play with, and it is great for hoarders like me for using up small strips of fabric.\nI hope you enjoyed that! I have a lot of things to keep me busy around here. I'm not the only one who has all of these works in progress, am I?\nToday I'm liking up over at WIP Wednesday at Freshly Pieced. Happy sewing!\nThis week I finally quilted my winter mystery quilt from winter 2014. This was a really fun mystery quilt put on by The Quilt Company. My mom purchased for herself, Aunt Brenda, and me a brown paper bag full of fabric (one for each of us) as a Christmas gift, having some idea of the color scheme but not seeing the fabric inside, and we received instructions throughout the winter to piece the top. This was one of the most fun gifts I received in a long time. She would not let us open our bags of fabric until Christmas Day, and the suspense was exciting! We also had fun working on our quilts together when received the next instructions.\nSo I quilted mine with a matching brown thread and one of my new pantographs called Trumpet Vine. I am really loving this design. I think I will bind it with the green fabric that I have left over.\nHere are pictures of our other finished mystery quilts. Mom's is hanging on display beautifully in her kitchen right now, and below you can see Aunt Brenda's quilt in action on one of the comfy chairs in her living room! That is Zeus, feline king of the castle.\nToday I updated my site to include the new pantographs that I have available. I am currently using Lyrical Bells on a customer quilt on the Innova right now. I also got one with Holly Berries, and I can't wait to try Snazzy Snowflake. Check them out here.\nRight now I have a 2-3 week turn around time on quilting for customers, so If you need something finished for the holidays, please contact me soon! Local customers often bring quilts to my home studio, but I am happy to meet you at one of our local quilt shops or any other agreed upon location, and mailing is always available if you are not close by.\nIt is Finish It Up Friday over at Crazy Mom Quilts. Go ahead and check out some other great finishes over there. Thanks so much for taking the time to visit!\nMy favorite thing about Halloween is definitely the fabric! I know some people are crazy for spooky stuff this time of year, and I admit it can be fun, but it just isn't a \"thing\" for me. Little snack size candy bars are nice this time of year, too, but one thing fabric won't do is cause weight gain.\nI just finished up two Halloween table runners that I made using the Creative Grids Scrap Crazy 6\" template set and the pattern that can be found in the Scrap Crazy 6\" book with instructions for projects using the templates. All I can say is you wouldn't believe how easy these were to piece. Click here for a link to the video demonstrating the templates to find out more about them. I love them! I'll just show you some pictures.\nOne of the table runners is pieced with batiks, the other with Halloween prints. They were quilted on my Innova with gray thread and a wiggly line pantograph. I really like the way they turned out. If you'd like to have one of these for yourself, feel free to visit my Etsy shop. If you'd like to make one of these for yourself, head to your local quilt shop, purchase the templates, and get busy with your scraps! I got mine at The Quilt Company. They are a lot of fun.\nIt is Finish It Up Friday, and I'm linking up at Crazy Mom Quilts today. Thanks for reading, and have a great day!", "version": "v0"}

In recent years, these two factors have become prominent as being levers for SME competitiveness and performance in an increasingly global marketplace. So far, SME business-level strategising when approaching foreign markets has been described as essentially unplanned and reactive or at best opportunistic. Only recently, in the field of international entrepreneurship, has the so-called entrepreneurial orientation, a combination of proactive, innovative and risk-taking behaviour, been identified as key influencer of fast and broad internationalisation. Here we ask whether any other strategic orientation constructs such as customer, market, and sales orientation described in the field of strategic management and marketing, do have an impact on internationalisation success and patterns. An empirical analysis of 150 Italian SMEs uncovers the presence of differentiated strategic types, their profile and their particular characteristics considered crucial for international performance. Possessing and developing a business strategy and related competencies proves to be a critical success factor for Italian SMEs going abroad, regardless of industry, company size or company age.", "version": "v0"}

In the 2018 season alone, three Artisan Farms horses represented the maple leaf, ridden by Canadian Olympians, Tiffany Foster and Eric Lamaze.\nParticularly essential to the Canadian Equestrian Team\u2019s Nations Cup success was 13-year-old Rheinlander gelding, Coco Bongo (Caretino x Calido), with whom Lamaze helped secure the team gold medal at the 2015 Toronto Pan American Games. The bay gelding jumped double-clear rounds with Lamaze at three competitions in 2018: the $450,000 Longines Nations Cup at CSIO 5* Ocala, FL in February; the \u20ac200,000 Nations Cup at CSIO 5* Rome, ITA in May; and the $460,000 BMO Nations Cup at the CSIO 5* Spruce Meadows \u2018Masters\u2019 tournament in Calgary, AB in September.\nVictor (Elmshorn x Grandeur), a 16-year-old Dutch Warmblood gelding, also contributed a double-clear round piloted by Foster in June\u2019s $400,000 Longines FEI Nations Cup at CSIO 5* Langley, BC. Their performance helped Canada clinch its invitation to the \u20ac300,000 Longines FEI Nations Cup Final, held in October in Barcelona, ESP. Outside of Nations Cup competition, Foster and Victor nabbed first place in May at the CSI 3* in Mannheim, GER.\nFoster also had an exceptional season riding the 12-year-old Dutch Warmblood gelding, Brighton (Contender II x Quick Star), with whom she competed in the Ocala Nations Cup alongside Lamaze. Together, the duo emerged victorious in the $70,000 CSI 5* Hollow Creek 1.50m Classic during the ninth week of the Winter Equestrian Festival. Foster and Brighton also earned two wins in June at Spruce Meadows, in the ALTAGAS Cup during the CSI 5* \u2018Continental\u2019 Tournament and the Friends of the Meadows Cup during the \u2018Pan American\u2019 CSI 5* presented by Rolex.\nLamaze made his own mark on Spruce Meadows over the summer with another outstanding talent from Artisan Farms: Fine Lady 5 (Forsyth FRH x Drosselklang II), a 15-year-old Hanoverian mare that was Lamaze\u2019s individual bronze medal partner at the 2016 Rio Olympics. The veteran pair earned a remarkable three-peat at the famous show grounds, winning the \u2018Continental\u2019 Grand Prix, followed by the Progress Energy Cup and the ATCO Queen Elizabeth II Cup during the Spruce Meadows \u2018North American\u2019 CSI 5* presented by Rolex.\nAlso racking up wins internationally was Chacco Kid (Chacco Blue x Come On), a 12-year-old Oldenburg who is owned by the Ziegler family through the Chacco Kid Group. Partnered with Lamaze, the chestnut gelding collected six FEI wins in 2018, including four at the advanced CSI 5* level: the Spruce Meadows \u2018Continental\u2019 Scotiabank Cup in June; the Prize of St\u00e4dteRegion Aachen, GER in July; the Global Champions League of London Round 2 in Great Britain in August; and the Spruce Meadows \u2018Masters\u2019 AKITA Drilling Cup in September.\nLamaze and Chacco Kid\u2019s consistent performances and lightning-fast speed earned the combination a spot on the Canadian Equestrian Team at the FEI World Equestrian Games\u2122 Tryon 2018 in September. There, they competed against the best show jumpers in the world to help Canada earn a respectable 10th-place finish in the Team Final.\nArtisan Farm\u2019s contributions to the Canadian Show Jumping Team and their horses\u2019 spectacular success in 2018 were recognized during a special presentation on Nov. 7, 2018 at the Royal Horse Show in Toronto, ON.\nEC is grateful for the level of dedication, commitment and support that owners generously provide in order to ensure that Canadian Equestrian Team athletes have access to world-class horses, and is pleased to recognize exceptional owners through the JC Owner of the Year Award.

For recruiters and HR personal alike, this comes as a blessing in disguise. With the job market set to become even more competitive, it will be more important than ever for people to not only re-examine their existing web presence, but also to make oneself more visible through self promotion.\nIn 2002 the PEW Internet Project reported that 52 million Americans used the Internet to search for a job, a 60% increase from 2000. By 2007, that number had nearly doubled with approximately 102 million or 51% of American adults using the Internet to look at job postings. Given a new resource to look at online resumes this behavioral trend has benefited HR Personal and Recruiters as well. With a viable new resource, the implications of online job hunting have meant more than just a decrease in newspaper ads and help wanted signs.\nAmong the many upsides of online recruitment are cost and reach. An SHRM study noted that the average cost per hire from an Internet recruiting strategy was $377 opposed to $3,295 from a major metro newspaper. With career and social networking sites such as Monster, Careerfinder, and LinkedIn supplying thousands of resumes in any number of occupations, recruiters now have access to a significantly larger pool of qualified candidates to pull from. In an interview with NPR,Maureen Crawford-Hentz of Osram Sylvania noted, \u201cSocial networking technology is absolutely the best thing to happen to recruiting \u2014 ever.\u201dOn Spock, 7% of our daily traffic is from recruiters or employment based searches. With occupation being one of the top tags that people list, it\u2019s no wonder that recruiters such as Monique Chin of iVedha have said, \u201cI have to admit I use Spock everyday\u2026for a recruiter competing with larger organizations, your site is an amazing equalizer\u201d.\nRecruiters aren\u2019t the only ones who benefit from this online revolution. For those looking at a career change, social networking and career sites have an open market effect where a potential candidate can explore multiple opportunities.\nAlong with increased access to resumes, people search tools such as Spock enable recruiters and HR personal to find out additional information about a person. Execunet.com conducted a survey of 100 executive recruiters, noting that 77% used applications such as Spock to learn more about a person and 35% of those had eliminated a candidate based on information uncovered. ExecuNet noted that it has not only become common practice to look up potential employees, but also to search for coworkers. With social networking sites such as Facebook and Myspace providing a popular platform for people to post pictures and information, there have been a number of reports advising people to limit their Web presence. Because of those warnings many people now feel an overwhelming need to censor and restrict their Web activity.\nWhile monitoring your Web presence for certain behavior is advised, there is a competing school of thought that increasing your Web presence is not only a good idea but also a necessity. By being on sites such as LinkedIn and Spock, it not only enables you to promote your strengths and interests, but also connect and network with others. As Monster.com notes, promoting your Web presence can help distinguish you from other candidates and give hiring managers insight about your personality. Thus, while you may want to shy away from sharing racy photos of your Bachelorette Party, a blog about fixing antique cars, or old photos from Halloween will often increase your chances of being hired.", "version": "v0"}

In an unusual move earlier this week, its Australian television operation, Network Ten, announced an equity offering and then pulled it the very next day.\nFairfax Financial Holdings Inc. already owns 22.41 per cent of Canwest's equity and the Globe and Mail reported that it may be seeking control. It reported that bankers close to the company suggest Fairfax or other investors (Canadian Press has reported that Onex Corp., run by the late Izzy Asper's former partner, Gerry Schwartz, may also be interested) would have to inject about $300 million to have an impact on the company's ability to stay out from under the mountain of debt.\nThere is some talk about the possibility that the Aspers could maintain control even with a new partner because of onerous benefit charges required by the regulators with a change of control of television assets.\nA myriad of scenarios is still possible including that the Aspers may loose what has become the crown jewel of corporate Winnipeg.\nA finance expert said, \"If Leonard (Asper) does not have the discipline to sell this or that asset, rest assured that Prem Watsa (CEO of Fairfax) will be in there doing it.\"\nThere are probably no more determined or proud operators than the Aspers. Senior executives have decamped to Toronto to a war-room setting and word has already been sent to the offices of the premier and the mayor assuring them that previously promised financing for a new football stadium from the family's real estate company, Creswin Properties, will not be compromised regardless of how things shake out at corporate Canwest.\nThe family and the company's relative community profile may be another story.\nThere is already talk around town about what Winnipeg will be like without the Asper/Canwest creativity, initiative and leadership.\n\"Winnipeg has two families, the Richardsons and the Aspers,\" one senior Winnipeg business figure said. \"Pretty soon there may be just be one.\"\nThe company has been famous for its complicated deals and corporate structures. Sources close to the company say there are not just one or two, but many options in dealing with the crisis.\n\"People are trying to get to the finish line but we are only one quarter of the way through the race,\" Canwest spokesman, John Douglas said. \"It is a very structured process with checkpoints along the way. One of them is a financial agreement with the senior banks that includes everything from examining non-core assets, reducing our cost structure and recapitalizing the company. There are a number of options.\"\nLate Friday, a source said it was likely that an operating line of credit will be re-established, perhaps with a lower ceiling.\nEven if that first hurdle is cleared it will likely not alter the reality that the company will still, at the least, be forced to sell assets at the worst possible time.", "version": "v0"}

We went snorkeling right in front of the hotel. A gem. Rooms kept clean as a pin. Fantastic experience and a very safe place to stay.\nBig Fish is a terrific beach-front stay on Big Corn Island. Friendly staff, and a simple, clean, air conditioned room are all you need on the island.\nBig Fish is really the perfect location on Big Corn Island. Two of the highest rated restaurants on the island are across the street or down the street. Their restaurant is also very good. The beach with supposedly great snorkeling is right across the street (although the weather did not cooperate during our stay). The dive shop is also a short walk down the beach. The staff is extremely friendly and very helpful. The rooms are fairly basic but that is reflected in the price - but they are clean with hot water showers. They have bicycle or snorkel gear rental and can help you with any planning that you need.\nGood location and restaurants nearby, including a great bakery. Friendly staff and easy to get to other locations. It was great to have hot water.\nOverall one always has to remember where you are in the world and for Corn Island staying at the Big Fish is a 5 star accommodation. Painted in bright yellow it has the most inviting presentation and they make you feel right at home. It seems like a stop over for the backpackers headed to Little Corn so there is always someone from another country to talk to.\nAir conditioning and water cooler with free drinking water was great to have.\nThe restaurant was great. The staff was outstanding. Hotel supplied snorkeling equipment and one can walk out the front door and snorkel in the lagoon in front of the hotel. We saw several large rays in the ocean in front of the hotel. Hotel helped arrange a super reasonable private boat trip to Little Corn Island with Captain Charles. Trip included snorkeling off Little Corn Island. Captain Charles picked us up on the beach in front of the hotel.\nStaff were wonderfully responsive to questions and needs.\nOne of our top picks in Big Corn Island.Facing the beachfront in Big Corn Island, Big Fish Guest House features a terrace and a bar. Featuring a tour desk, this property also provides guests with a restaurant. Free WiFi is included.\nAt the guesthouse, each room comes with a closet. The rooms at Big Fish Guest House come with a flat-screen TV with cable channels.\nCorn Islands is 1.4 miles from the accommodation. The nearest airport is Corn Island Airport, 3.7 miles from Big Fish Guest House.\nThis property also has one of the top-rated locations in Big Corn Island! Guests are happier about it compared to other properties in the area.\nThis property is also rated for the best value in Big Corn Island! Guests are getting more for their money when compared to other properties in this city.\nWhen would you like to stay at Big Fish Guest House?\nHouse Rules Big Fish Guest House takes special requests \u2013 add in the next step!\nBig Fish Guest House accepts these cards and reserves the right to temporarily hold an amount prior to arrival.\nThe shower was a little difficult to operate if you\u2019re short. And like the rest of the island - it\u2019s not warm. There\u2019s also no WiFi in the house but the restaurant has.\nMary and her kids are awesome. She\u2019s a great host and the property is very comfortable. It\u2019s also next door to the best bakery on the island and close enough to the dive school. There\u2019s a lovely beach opposite and the restaurant is great too!\nWonderful gem on Big Corn Island. Came highly recommended from an ex-pat local.... glad I stayed! Three wonderful things about BigFish: 1) incredibly welcoming, kind and nice host. The owner went out of her way to tell me about the area and the history. She went out of her way to give me with sunburn cream after I sat in the sun too long! 2) Nice location on a great beach. Location is everything and how wonderful it was to walk out the front door and have a beach for lounging and swimming just steps away. The beach is white sands, slow waves and postcard beautiful. The only thing that stands between you and the beach is a restaurant (owned by BigFish) which has great food- so good that the islanders bring all their guests there! 3) WiFi & A/C. Both strong and refreshing. The owners of the property are a Nicaraguan/American family and you can see the love they have for the island and the pleasure they get out of sharing it with travelers. They are so warm and welcoming- you won\u2019t regret booking here!\nthey did not have our reservation when we arrived. they did give us a room and we were happy with it.\nright across from a great beach. food was amazing. room was exactly what we were expecting based on description and pictures. can rent a scooter to explore the island right next door for $10. i would stay here again.\nIt would be a great addition if they included even a simple breakfast. Food prices on the island can be a bit tourism-inflated, and being able to start the day even with coffee and fruit in the hotel would be a nice touch.\nHot water heater was unit attached with electrical wires directly to shower head. Two of us got a brief electrical shock while showering and there was no hot water in any case.\nThe food seemed more expensive than other places we stayed in Nicaragua but seemed comparable to other places on Big Corn.\nThe location of the property was excellent. There are a couple of restaurants, a bakery and a bike and scooter place all right there and it is just across from a nice beach! The staff were very helpful and especially friendly. The bed and pillows were some of the best we had in a month in Nicaragua and a/c was nice to. While there was no real view from the room it was very quiet.\nI thought the food was too pricey for Nicaragua, so I ate at the dive centre or in Bridg Bay or Sally Peachie most days instead.\nThe staff were incredibly friendly and I really felt at home for the week. My room was spotless every day I returned home from diving with Dos Tiburones just down the road. The location is fabulous, ten minutes north of the town and across the road from a lovely, sandy beach.\nIt was close to the beach.\nLittle problem with getting warm water for the shower, but staff dealt with this right away.", "version": "v0"}

The final loop (which can be omitted) includes the Horniman Museum & Gardens. There is some overlap with the Sydenham Common walk.\nExit station on the down side and go along Lennard Road. First left into Maitland Road, continuing through Alexandra Recreation Ground.\nThis park was opened in 1891.\nThe Croydon Canal was built in 1809 but in 1836 was bought by the London & Croydon Railway who replaced it with their track. A new road off Venner Road has been named Canal Walk.\nBetween 1903 and 1979 there was a station booking hall on the bridge. The Greyhound (built around 1720) was Sydenham oldest inn but the site is being redeveloped for housing. The ladies' outfitters on Cobb's Corner was founded by Walter Cobb in 1860 and extended in 1902. In 1940 three quarters of the shop with its contents was destroyed in an air raid but business continued in the undamaged part. It was restored and rebuilt after the war, becoming a department store. In the 1920s doctors occupied the old parsonage which had been built for Charles English in 1848. It was replaced by Kirkdale Corner in the 1930s.\nOld Cedars, built in the 18th century, is now a care centre. Hall Drive was the former drive to Sydenham Hall, the home of the builder Edward Strong the Younger. The house was rebuilt around 1805, became a school in the 1900s and was demolished in 1939.\nThis was designed by Lewis Vuillamy and built in 1827-32 but did not become the parish church until 1856. The first vicar Charles English has an unusual tomb depicting a church. Alongside the entrance path is a memorial to men killed whilst working on the construction of the Crystal Palace (see plaque).\nNumber 12 (marked with a blue plaque) was the home of the Shackleton family from which Henry practised as a doctor. There were 8 daughters and two sons including Ernest, who was to become famous as an Antarctic explorer.\nNumber 7 (marked with a blue plaque) was the home of Eleanor, daughter of Karl Marx. In 1898 she took her own life here by drinking prussic acid, having discovered her lover had secretly married.\nThis commemorates Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897. The site behind this (now retirement homes) was once the telephone exchange. Prior to this it had been a public hall and earlier the Fir Lodge School, attended by Ernest Shackleton. St Bartholmew\u0092s National School was replaced by the R C Church (1974).\nFor the Victorians this and part of Dartmouth Road was the main shopping centre of Sydenham and was known as the High Street (until 1936). The former Woodman pub is now an estate agents. The Kirkdale Learning Centre was built in 1861 to the designs of Joseph Paxton and Henry Dawson to house an institute and schools. Additions were made in 1905. The two weatherboarded cottages opposite (in poor condition) would have been some of the first buildings to have been built on Sydenham Common after its enclosure in 1819.\nNumber 2 (then Charles Street) was the home of John Scott Russell, the civil and marine engineer. Brunel\u0092s Great Eastern ship was built at his yard in Millwall and he also constructed The Warrior (berthed at Portsmouth). The 1851 census records Russell with his wife, five children and three servants at the address.\nAt the end you come into Baxter\u0092s Field.\nIn 1867 George Baxter, who had developed a new colour printing technique, was killed by a horse drawn vehicle. This open space was named after him (see information board).\nThe church spire came from St Antholin in Watling Street, built by Christopher Wren in the 1680s. It was moved to Round Hill House (demolished in the 1860s) as a folly around 1850.\nTwo large handsome houses of 1857 on the right hand side have been incorporated into the Courtside development.\nHoly Trinity School was opened in 1874. The 1900 library is an attractive building. Next door, the former Girls' Industrial Home of 1891 (known as Louise House) is currently boarded up. The swimming baths of 1885 have been developed into a new leisure centre. All these were built on land which was granted to the vicar of Lewisham at the enclosure of Sydenham Common in 1819. The Bird in Hand was built c1819 and numbers 29-33 adjacent were originally cottages with canalside gardens, later enlarged and converted to shops. Number 18 (Wok Express) was the site of the The Empire Picture Playhouse which opened in 1910 and closed in 1914. It had 400 seats and a tea room. The Dartmouth Arms (also c1819) gave its name to the nearby station (until 1845).\nThe charity shop was a former Sainsburys (see tilework in entrance). The Grade II listed Capitol Cinema opposite became a pub in 2001. It was designed in 1928 by John Stanley Beard. It closed in 1973 and was used for bingo 1978-1996.\nRight along Havelock Walk which exits into Davids Road. Go left here then left into Pearcefield Avenue.\nThis was the site of a pond which served the Croydon Canal.\nWalk through the supermarket car park then continue along the pathway.\nThe wall to the left is decorated with motifs from the Horniman Museum.\nRight at London Road. Walk along the frontage of the Horniman Museum buildings (see information boards) and enter the park beyond these.\nWalk up through the park bearing right and exit into Horniman Drive.

Detour left into Honor Oak Road.\nAshberry Cottage was built in 1780 for Mrs Jordan, the mistress of the Duke of Clarence, later William IV.\nOn the left is The Church International. The raised footway was the towpath bank of the canal. Post-canal buildings (numbers 3-13) include another church building. On the corner to the left is a former public lavatory. There are brickwork and information panels on the last section of wall alongside a cobbled ramp.\nThe station was rebuilt in 1972, having been badly bombed in 1944.", "version": "v0"}

But Lonari never got the kind of exposure in the field of computers back in his village which is why he had to move to Pune and study here.\n\u201cAll along while I was studying to be an engineer in Pune, the one thing that never got out of my mind was that there are so many people just like me, who want to pursue certain things back in their village, but due to lack of opportunities and infrastructure, they are compelled to leave their homes and families, and adapt to a new atmosphere,\u201d says Lonari, who recently won the Winners of Worthiness (WOW) award in Pune.\nShobhaa Arya, owner and founder of WOW, gave away the award. Winning the award has given Lonari an additional boost to perform well. He not only wants a better life for him and his parents back in his village but he also wants to give youngsters there a better opportunity to grow and do well in life. \u201cI have always had the desire and determination to develop my village which is why I got a degree and started my software company. I strongly believe that digital literacy is the way forward,\u201d he says.\nLonari, who founded Skiver IT Solution in 2014, caters to backend software solutions, right from developing apps to setting up websites for companies or clients and giving them a headstrong start in the digital space. Currently, the company has a strong team of nine people. Lonari points out that hard work and dedication of the entire team helped them open branches in Pune, Nashik and Aurangabad.\nBut success doesn\u2019t come easy. He says that there are times when it becomes really challenging to run a company, but what matters is how strong is your team and the bonding. \u201cBeing a young boss I have learnt that working as a team is really beneficial, so we have a friendly set-up rather than a hierarchical structure at our workplace,\u201d says Lonari adding that the performance of employees determines the performance of a company but all this depends on how the employees gel with each other. \u201cThis is one of the reasons that I decided to keep my relationship with my colleagues more friendly than bossy, and it definitely has helped us learn from each other and perform as a team,\u201d he says.\nHe mentions that since most of his staff members come from humble backgrounds, what really clicks with all of them is the fact, that they too, just like him, want to do something for their families back in their hometown or village, and make a difference in the lives of other youngsters and bring about a positive change in society.\nWhen asked about his immediate plans when it comes to his company, Lonari says that currently they have two software products that will be launched in March and April, which will cater to tracking services for tours and travel companies.", "version": "v0"}

Here we present cryo-EM structures of human TPC2 (HsTPC2), a phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2)-activated, Na+ selective channel, in the ligand-bound and apo states. The apo structure captures the closed conformation, while the ligand-bound form features the channel in both open and closed conformations. Combined with functional analysis, these structures provide insights into the mechanism of PI(3,5)P2-regulated gating of TPC2, which is distinct from that of TPC1. Specifically, the endolysosome-specific PI(3,5)P2 binds at the first 6-TM and activates the channel \u2013 independently of the membrane potential \u2013 by inducing a structural change at the pore-lining inner helix (IS6), which forms a continuous helix in the open state but breaks into two segments at Gly317 in the closed state. Additionally, structural comparison to the voltage-dependent TPC1 structure allowed us to identify Ile551 as being responsible for the loss of voltage dependence in TPC2.\nTwo-pore channels (TPCs) belong to the voltage-gated ion channel superfamily and function as a homodimer, with each subunit containing two homologous Shaker-like 6-TM repeats. TPC1 and TPC2 represent two major subfamilies of mammalian TPC channels, and have been subjected to extensive studies (Grimm et al., 2017; Patel, 2015). TPC1 and TPC2 are localized to the endolysosomal membrane and control the ionic homeostasis of these acidic organelles. TPC functions have been shown to be associated with a plethora of physiological processes, including mTOR-dependent nutrient sensing (Cang et al., 2013), Ebola infection (Sakurai et al., 2015) and autophagy (Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2016; Pereira et al., 2011). Despite their physiological importance, the biophysical properties of mammalian TPC channels are still under debate. Initial studies suggested that TPCs mediate nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP)-dependent calcium release from the endolysosome (Brailoiu et al., 2009; Calcraft et al., 2009; Zong et al., 2009). However, several recent studies have demonstrated that mammalian TPCs are sodium-selective channels activated by the endolysosome specific lipid phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2) rather than NAADP (Cang et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2012). The plasma membrane-localized PI(4,5)P2 cannot activate the TPC channels; thus, the lipid isoform-dependent gating property defines the compartment specific channel activity of TPCs. Distinct from TPC2, mammalian TPC1 activation is also voltage-dependent, conferring electrical excitability to the endolysosome (Cang et al., 2014).\nOur recent cryo-EM structure of mouse TPC1 (MmTPC1) provided crucial insights into the ion selectivity and gating mechanisms of mammalian TPC channels \u2013 particularly the structural basis of PI(3,5)P2 and voltage-dependent gating of mammalian TPC1 (She et al., 2018). TPC2, however, shares low sequence identity to MmTPC1 (24%, Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1) and exhibits distinct physiological and gating properties. While TPC1 is widely expressed throughout the endolysosomal pathway, TPC2 is preferentially expressed in the late endosome/lysosome (Brailoiu et al., 2009; Calcraft et al., 2009); TPC2 has been shown to be associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease (Hockey et al., 2015) and blood vessel formation (Favia et al., 2014); TPC2-knockout mice are highly susceptible to non-alcoholic fatty liver hepatitis, the role of TPC1, however, remains unclear (Grimm et al., 2014). Additionally, unlike the voltage-dependent TPC1, TPC2 can be activated solely by PI(3,5)P2 binding. Here we present the cryo-EM structures of human TPC2 (HsTPC2) in both the ligand-bound and apo states, which reveal the structural basis of phospholipid binding as well as its activation mechanism.\nBy replacing Leu11 and Leu12 on the N-terminal lysosomal targeting sequence with alanines, HsTPC2 can be over-expressed and trafficked to the plasma membrane in HEK293 cells (Brailoiu et al., 2010; Jha et al., 2014). This mutation (Leu11Ala/Leu12Ala) results in better protein expression and also allows for direct measurement of channel activity by patch-clamp recording of the plasma membrane. Therefore, this mutant construct was used and defined as the wild-type channel in our structural and functional studies.\nThe structures of HsTPC2 were determined in the presence and absence of PI(3,5)P2 by single particle cryo-EM (Figure 1, Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 2, 3 and 4 and Figure 1\u2014source data 1). The apo structure of HsTPC2 represents the closed conformation and was determined to 3.5 \u00c5. Interestingly, the single particles of HsTPC2 in the presence of PI(3,5)P2 can be partitioned into two classes of particles, and 3D refinement yielded HsTPC2 structures in the open and closed conformations at 3.7 \u00c5 and 3.4 \u00c5 resolution, respectively. The 3:5 ratio of the particles between the open and closed conformations in the PI(3,5)P2-bound structure of HsTPC2 likely represents the ligand efficacy of channel activation. Other than the presence or absence of ligand density, the structures of the apo closed and the ligand-bound closed states are virtually identical with a main-chain RMSD of 0.46 \u00c5; we, therefore, will use the ligand-bound structures in most of the discussion. It is worth noting that the observation of both the closed and open conformations of a ligand-gated channel in the presence of ligand has been observed in other channel structural studies using single particle cryo-EM such as the Slo2 channel (Hite and MacKinnon, 2017).\n(A) Topology and domain arrangement of an HsTPC2 subunit. (B) Cartoon representation of HsTPC2 with one subunit colored as that in (A) and another in pink. PI(3,5)P2 are shown as yellow sticks. The two EF-hand domains are boxed. (C) Overall structural alignment of HsTPC2 (cyan) and MmTPC1 (pink).\nLike other TPC channels, HsTPC2 functions as a dimer with each subunit containing two homologous six-transmembrane domains (6-TM I and 6-TM II) (Figure 1). Following the same nomenclature as other voltage-gated channels, we labeled the six transmembrane helices within each 6-TM domain as IS1-S6 and IIS1-S6, respectively (Figure 1A). Like most voltage-gated ion channels, the transmembrane region of HsTPC2 is domain swapped, with the S1-S4 voltage-sensing domain (VSD) from one 6-TM interacting with the S5-S6 pore domain from the neighboring 6-TM (Figure 1B). Despite sharing low sequence identity, the overall structures of HsTPC2 and MmTPC1 can be well aligned (Figure 1C). Similar to MmTPC1, the linker between the two 6-TMs adopts an EF-hand domain structure but with two EF-hand motifs (EF-1 and EF-2) lacking the essential acidic residues for Ca2+ coordination and an E1 helix extending from the C-terminus of the exceptionally long IS6 helix (Figure 1A,B and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1). A major difference between the two channels is that HsTPC2 lacks the long C-terminal region that forms a horseshoe-shaped structure around the EF-hand domain in MmTPC1 (She et al., 2018).\nThe HsTPC2 ion conduction pore consists of S5, S6 and two pore helices (Figure 1A). In the channel dimer, two sets of filter residues enclose the central ion pathway with different dimensions (Figure 2A): filter I, with the sequence Thr271-Ala272, lines the pathway using main-chain backbone carbonyls with atom-to-atom cross distances of larger than 7 \u00c5; filter II, with the sequence Val652-Asn653-Asn654, utilizes side chains to generate a much narrower pathway \u2013 with the two Asn653 residues forming the narrowest constriction point and playing the central role in determining Na+ selectivity (Guo et al., 2017b; She et al., 2018). In sharing identical filter sequence and structure, mammalian TPC1 and TPC2 should utilize the same structural mechanism to achieve Na+ selectivity as was demonstrated in our previous study (She et al., 2018). In plant TPC, the central filter residue, equivalent to Asn653 of HsTPC2 is a glycine and, thus, renders the plant channel non-selective (Guo et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2017b).\nIon conduction pore of HsTPC2.\n(A) The selectivity filter formed by filter I and filter II with the front subunit removed for clarity.

Numbers are cross distances (in \u00c5) at the constriction points. (D) Structural comparison of the cytosolic gate between the closed and open states viewed from the cytosolic side in two sections: Thr308/Leu690 (top) and Tyr312/Leu694 (below). (E) Side view of the EM density (green mesh) in the cytosolic gate of PI(3,5)P2-bound open structure. The filter region and the cytosolic gate are boxed. (F) Sample I\u2013V curves of HsTPC2 recorded using inside-out patches with or without GDN in bath solutions. Data shown in (F) were repeated five times independently with similar results.\nThe HsTPC2 ion conduction pore adopts both closed and open conformations in the ligand-bound state (Figure 2B,C,D). In the closed conformation, four pairs of residues consisting of Thr308s and Tyr312s from IS6 and Leu690s and Leu694s from IIS6, form the constriction points at the cytosolic side and prevent the passage of hydrated cations (Figure 2B,C). In the open state, these constriction-forming residues dilate and rotate away from the central axis, resulting in a much wider opening at the intracellular gate (Figure 2B,C,D). This pore opening and closing mechanics of HsTPC2 is highly similar to that of MmTPC1. The mechanism by which PI(3,5)P2 regulates HsTPC2 gating will be further discussed later. Interestingly, we also observed two long stretches of density plugging the open gate in the open HsTPC2 structure (Figure 2E). This density likely comes from the GDN detergent used for sample preparation. Indeed, GDN can inhibit the HsTPC2 channel from the cytosolic side likely by functioning as an open-pore blocker (Figure 2F). A similar digitonin-like molecule occluding the open gate has also been reported in the structure of the voltage-gated sodium channel from electric eel (Yan et al., 2017).\nAlthough the two voltage sensing domains (VSD) of HsTPC2 contain multiple positively charged arginines on the S4 helices, channel activation is achieved independently of the membrane potential. Figure 3A provides the sequence alignment of the S4 helices from TPCs and other canonical voltage-gated channels with the positions of the gating charge residues numbered from R1 to R5. VSD1 of HsTPC2 is structurally similar to that of MmTPC1. The IS4 helix contains three arginine residues at positions R2-R4 (Arg185, Arg188 and Arg191) with their charged side chains pointing towards the luminal surface (Figure 3B). However, several conserved features of a canonical voltage sensing domain are absent in HsTPC2 VSD1, thus rendering it voltage insensitive (Figure 3B): the acidic residue on S3 that is part of the gating charge transfer center is Tyr161; the conserved basic residue at the R5 position becomes Phe194; and IS4 forms a short regular alpha helix instead of a 310 helix.\n(A) Partial S4 sequence alignment and arginine registry. Residues at the R1-R5 positions on IS4 and IIS4 of HsTPC2 are numbered. (B) Side view of VSD1 with IS1 omitted for clarity. (C) Side view of VSD2 with IIS1 omitted for clarity. (D and E) Sample traces and I-V curves of voltage activation of HsTPC2 (D) and its IIS4 arginine mutation Ile551Arg (E) recorded in the whole cell configuration with 10 \u00b5M PI(3,5)P2 in the pipette. Sample I-V curves were obtained from the currents at the end of the activation voltage steps. Data shown in (D) and (E) were repeated five times independently with similar results.\nWith two arginines at positions R4 (Arg554) and R5 (Arg557) on IIS4, VSD2 of HsTPC2 preserves some key features of a canonical voltage sensor, including the formation of a 310 helix in a part of IIS4 and the presence of the conserved gating charge transfer center surrounded by Tyr480, Glu483 and Asp505 (Figure 3C). These structural features are highly similar to VSD2 of MmTPC1, which contributes to the voltage-dependent gating of TPC1, yet HsTPC2 is voltage independent (Figure 3D). One key difference between the VSD2 of these two channels is that the R3 position of HsTPC2 is an isoleucine instead of an arginine, which contributes to the loss of voltage-dependence in TPC2 channels (Figure 3A,C). In two recent studies, replacing the R3 arginine of mammalian TPC1 with Gln or Ile can yield a voltage-independent channel that can be activated solely by PI(3,5)P2 \u2013 analogous to TPC2 (Cang et al., 2014; She et al., 2018). Conversely, we can also convert HsTPC2 to a voltage-dependent channel by introducing an arginine to the R3 position (Ile551Arg mutant), which yields a mutant channel whose activation requires both PI(3,5)P2 and a positive membrane potential (Figure 3E). Thus, the presence or absence of an arginine at the R3 position determines the voltage dependence of mammalian TPC channels. In HsTPC2, the gating charge transfer center is occupied by Arg554 at the R4 position (Figure 3C). By introducing an R3 arginine in the Ile551Arg mutant, we envision that hyperpolarized (negative) membrane potential can drive a downward sliding motion of the IIS4 helix by one helical turn with the R3 arginine positioned at the gating charge transfer. As will be discussed later, this movement would occlude the space necessary for the outward movement of the IIS4-S5 linker that is associated with pore opening and, thereby, results in a voltage-dependent inhibition of channel gating similar to the voltage gating mechanism of MmTPC1 (She et al., 2018).\nThe ligand affinity and specificity of HsTPC2 were measured in excised patches. The PI(3,5)P2 concentration-dependent activation of the channel yielded an EC50 of about 480 nM (Figure 4A and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A) similar to that measured in whole lysosome patch (Wang et al., 2012). In contrast, PI(4,5)P2, PI(3,4)P2, PI(3)P and PI(5)P have no obvious effect on channel activation, illustrating the high ligand specificity of HsTPC2 (Figure 4B and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B).\n(A) Concentration-dependent PI(3,5)P2 activation of HsTPC2 at \u2212100 mV.

Source data for Figure 4A,B,E and F are available in Figure 4\u2014source data 1.\nThe PI(3,5)P2 ligand can be clearly defined from the cryo-EM maps of the ligand-bound structures (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4C,D). Similar to that in MmTPC1, PI(3,5)P2 is situated at the junction formed by IS3, IS4, and the IS4-S5 linker of the 6-TM I (Figure 4C,D). The inositol 1,3,5-trisphosphate head group of PI(3,5)P2 interacts with multiple basic residues and defines most of the ligand-protein interactions (Figure 4C,D), while the acyl chains of PI(3,5)P2 insert upright into the membrane. One notable difference between HsTPC2 and MmTPC1 is that most of the basic residues involved in PI(3,5)P2 binding, particularly those on the IS4-S5 linker, are predominantly lysines in HsTPC2 instead of arginines as in MmTPC1 (Figure 4C,D and Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1). Mutations of these lysine residues (Lys203, Lys204 and Lys207) have profound effect on PI(3,5)P2 activation (Figure 4E,F and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C,D,E). Residues on IS6 also participate in PI(3,5)P2 interactions in a state-dependent manner. In the ligand-bound, closed state, Arg329 forms a salt bridge with the C3-phosphate (Figure 4C), while in the ligand-bound open form, Arg329 forms salt bridges with both the C3- and C5-phosphates as well as a hydrogen bond with the C4 hydroxyl group; additionally, Ser322 forms a hydrogen bond with the C5-phosphate only in the open conformation (Figure 4D). This state-dependent PI(3,5)P2 interaction with IS6 is associated with the IS6 conformational change that causes the opening and closing of the pore and will be discussed below. Between the two IS6 residues that interact with PI(3,5)P2 in the open state, Arg329 appears to play the determinant role in channel gating as its mutation (Arg329Ala) almost completely abolishes channel activity whereas the Ser322Ala mutation reduces the channel activity to a lesser extent (Figure 4E,F and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C,D,E). This is distinct from MmTPC1 where a single lysine (Lys331) on IS6 at the position equivalent to Ser322 of HsTPC2 interacts with PI(3,5)P2 and determines the ligand-dependent gating of MmTPC1 (She et al., 2018). It is worth noting that our structural observation of PI(3,5)P2 binding in HsTPC2 matches quite well with the recent molecular dynamic simulation study that predicted the lipid binding site based on the structure of PI(3,5)P2-insensitive plant TPC1 (Kirsch et al., 2018).\nThe structures of HsTPC2 in three different states \u2013 apo closed, ligand-bound closed, and ligand-bound open \u2013 allowed us to elucidate the structural basis of the channel\u2019s PI(3,5)P2-dependent gating mechanism (Figure 5). The apo structure of HsTPC2 is virtually identical to the ligand-bound closed state with the exception being the absence of PI(3,5)P2 density (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1), suggesting that the ligand binding pocket can readily accommodate PI(3,5)P2 without undergoing any conformational change. Pore opening and closing is triggered by a conformational change at the IS6 helix. In the closed state, the IS6 helix breaks into two halves at Gly317, just below the cytosolic gate, while in the open state, IS6 becomes a long continuous helix (Figure 4C,D and Figure 5A). This conformational change is likely initiated by the interaction between Arg329 and PI(3,5)P2. Upon ligand binding, the Arg329 side chain adopts an extended configuration to form salt bridges with the PI(3,5)P2 phosphate groups (Figure 5A); this interaction provides an outward force to pull the IS6 helix into the straight conformation; meanwhile, Ser322 forms a hydrogen bond with the C5-phosphate of PI(3,5)P2 to help stabilize the IS6 helix in the open conformation. The fact that we observed both closed and open conformations in the ligand-bound structure suggests that HsTPC2 toggles in dynamic equilibrium between these two states in the presence of PI(3,5)P2 (Figure 5C).\n(A and B) Structural comparison between the PI(3,5)P2-bound open (pink) and closed (blue) HsTPC2 with zoomed-in views of the structural changes at IS6 (A) and IIS(6)/IIS4-S5 (B) regions. Arrows indicate structural movements. Key gating residues are shown as yellow sticks. The \u03c0-helix in IIS6 is shown in green. (C) Working model for PI(3,5)P2 activation of HsTPC2.\nThe movement of IS6 from the closed to open state results in the outward dilation and rotation of gating residues (Tyr312 and Thr308) at the bundle crossing (Figure 2D). To accommodate the PI(3,5)P2-induced conformational change at IS6, the IIS6 pair of helices undergoes a concurrent movement to give rise to a similar outward dilation and rotation of the helix and, consequently, a similar motion of the IIS6 gating residues (Leu690 and Leu694) (Figure 2D). The concurrent motion at IIS6 hinges around the five-residue \u03c0-helix that is situated in the middle of IIS6 and propagated to a larger motion at the C-terminal end (Figure 5B). The presence of \u03c0-helix on S6 as a gating hinge has also been observed in some other tetrameric cation channels such as TRP channels (Chen et al., 2017; Hughes et al., 2018). Being tightly packed with the C-terminal part of IIS6, the IIS4-S5 linker has to swing outward along with IIS6. Interestingly, in the closed state, IIS4 and the IIS4-S5 linker is connected by a five-residue loop; upon channel opening, the loop undergoes structural rearrangement and the three residues preceding the IIS4-S5 linker helix are restructured to be part of the linker helix (Figure 5B). This restructuring allows the IIS4-S5 linker to swing outward upon channel opening without inducing movement in IIS4. Thus, the loop between IIS4 and the IIS4-S5 linker provides the necessary space for the linker motion that is associated with channel opening.\nThe structural change at the loop also explains the voltage-dependent gating of the Ile551Arg mutation in HsTPC2. The downward sliding motion of the IIS4 helix in the mutant channel \u2013 driven by membrane hyperpolarization \u2013 would occlude the space necessary for the IIS4-S5 linker\u2019s movement and, thereby, inhibit movement in IIS6 and channel opening (Figure 5B). In essence, this voltage-gating mechanism is similar to that of MmTPC1; that is, IIS4 movement in response to a change in membrane potential generates (depolarization) or occludes (hyperpolarization) the space necessary for the movement of the IIS6 and IIS4-S5 linker that is associated with PI(3,5)P2-induced channel opening (She et al., 2018). In other words, voltage activation does not directly activate TPC channels but, instead, removes the inhibition exerted by the IIS4-S5 linker and allows the channel to be activated by PI(3,5)P2.\nIn this study, we reveal the structural mechanism of how PI(3,5)P2 activates human TPC2. Phosphoinositide is a key signaling lipid that plays essential roles in many cellular signaling processes (Di Paolo and De Camilli, 2006; Falkenburger et al., 2010), and there are growing examples of ion channels and transporters whose functions are directly regulated by specific phosphoinositide (Hilgemann et al., 2001). While structural understanding of PIP2 regulation of ion channels have been well-studied on the 2-TM inward rectifier channels (Hansen et al., 2011; Whorton and MacKinnon, 2011), little is known about the structural basis of PIP2 activation or modulation of the more dominant 6-TM tetrameric cation channels. Our current study of HsTPC2, along with MmTPC1 in a previous study (She et al., 2018), provides crucial structural insights into the location of phosphoinositide binding, lipid isoform specificity, and mechanism of lipid activation. In addition to the TPC channel family, the lysosomal TRPML channel is also activated by PI(3,5)P2 (Dong et al., 2010; Feng et al., 2014). However, the TRPML ligand-gating mechanism is likely to be different from that of TPC because the PI(3,5)P2 binding occurs at the N-terminal pre-S1 region in TRPML \u2013 distal from the ion conduction pore (Chen et al., 2017; Dong et al., 2010). Furthermore, while PI(4,5)P2 does not bind TPC1, it can competitively bind to TRPML and inhibits channel activity (Zhang et al., 2012). Several other members in the TRP channel family are known to be regulated by the plasma membrane specific PI(4,5)P2. The PI(4,5)P2 binding site in TRPV5 is analogous to the observed PI(3,5)P2 binding site in TPC (Hughes et al., 2018). The activation of TRPM4 is modulated by PI(4,5)P2, but the lipid binding site remains elusive (Guo et al., 2017a). Thus, various isoforms of phosphoinositide can impose diverse actions on a wide range of channels at different cellular locations and, thereby, generate a broad range of signaling responses.\nThe Leu11Ala/Leu12Ala mutant of Human TPC2 (HsTPC2, NCBI accession: AY029200) containing an N-terminal 8x His tag followed by a GFP tag and a thrombin cleavage site was cloned into a pEZT-BM vector (Morales-Perez et al., 2016) and heterologously expressed in Freestyle 293F cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the BacMam system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The Leu11Ala and Leu12Ala mutations promote channel expression and trafficking to the plasma membrane of the HEK293 cell. The baculovirus was generated in Sf9 cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following standard protocol and used to infect Freestyle 293F cells at a ratio of 1:40 (virus:cells, v:v) and supplemented with 10 mM sodium butyrate to boost protein expression. Cells were cultured in suspension at 37\u00b0C for 48 hr and harvested by centrifugation at 3000 x g. All purification procedures were carried out at 4\u00b0C. The cell pellet was re-suspended in buffer A (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (containing 2 \u03bcg/ml DNAse, 0.5 \u03bcg/ml pepstatin, 2 \u03bcg/ml leupeptin, and 1 \u03bcg/ml aprotinin and 0.1 mM PMSF) and homogenized by sonication on ice. HsTPC2 was extracted with 1% (w:v) n-Dodecyl-\u03b2-D-Maltopyranoside (DDM) (Anatrace) supplemented with 0.2% (w:v) cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS, Sigma Aldrich) by gentle agitation for 2 hr. After extraction, the supernatant was collected after a 60 min centrifugation at 20,000 x g and incubated with Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) using gentle agitation. After 2 hr, the resin was collected on a disposable gravity column (Bio-Rad). The resin was washed with buffer B (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 0.06% glycol-diosgenin (GDN, Anatrace) supplemented with 20 mM imidazole. The washed resin was left on column in buffer B and digested with thrombin (Roche) overnight. After thrombin digestion, the flow-through containing untagged HsTPC2 was collected, concentrated, and purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer B. The peak fraction was pooled and concentrated to 3.3 mg/ml for cryo-electron microscopy analysis. To obtain the phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2) bound structure, the protein sample was supplemented with 0.5 mM PI(3,5)P2 diC8 (Echelon) for 30 min on ice before EM grids preparation. HEK293 (CRL-1573) cell lines were purchased from and authenticated by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Freestyle 293F cells (RRID:CVCL_D603) were purchased from and authenticated by Thermo Fisher Scientific. The cell lines were not tested for mycoplasma contamination as they were used for protein expression only.\nThe cryo-EM grids were prepared by applying HsTPC2 (3.3 mg/ml, with or without 0.5 mM PI(3,5)P2) to a glow-discharged Quantifoil R1.2/1.3 300-mesh gold holey carbon grid (Quantifoil, Micro Tools GmbH, Germany). Grids were blotted for 4.0 s under 100% humidity at 4\u00b0C before being plunged into liquid ethane using a Mark IV Vitrobot (FEI). Micrographs were acquired on a Titan Krios microscope (FEI) operated at 300 kV with a K2 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan), using a slit width of 20 eV on a GIF-Quantum energy filter. Images were recorded with EPU software (FEI) in super-resolution counting mode with a super resolution pixel size of 0.535 \u00c5. The defocus range was set from \u22121.5 \u03bcm to \u22123 \u03bcm. Each micrograph was dose-fractionated to 30 frames under a dose rate of 4 e-/pixel/s, with a total exposure time of 15 s, resulting in a total dose of about 50 e-/\u00c52.\nMicrographs were motion corrected and binned two fold (yielding a pixel size of 1.07 \u00c5/pixel) with MotionCor2 (Zheng et al., 2017). The CTF parameters of the micrographs were estimated using the GCTF program (Zhang, 2016). All other steps of image processing were performed using RELION2.0 (Kimanius et al., 2016). Initially, ~1000 particles were manually picked from a few micrographs. Class averages representing projections of HsTPC2 in different orientations were selected from the 2D classification of the manually picked particles and used as templates for automatic particle picking from the full dataset. 653,430 particles were picked from 2287 micrographs. The particles were extracted and binned three times (3.21 \u00c5/pixel). After 2D classification, a total of 473,552 particles were finally selected for 3D classification using MmTPC1 structure (PDB accession number 6C9A) as the initial mode. The 3D classes showed good secondary structure features and were selected and re-extracted into the original pixel size of 1.07 \u00c5. After 3D refinement with C2 symmetry imposed and particle polishing, the resulting 3D reconstructions from ~310 K particles showed a clear 2-fold symmetry with a resolution of 3.4 \u00c5. We then performed a focused 3D classification with density subtraction (Bai et al., 2015). In this approach, only the density corresponding to the pore domain was kept in each particle image by subtracting the density for all other parts including the belt-like detergent density from the original particles. The subsequent 3D classification on the modified particles was carried out by applying a mask around the pore domain with all the particle orientations fixed at the value determined in the initial 3D refinement. After this round of classification, one class showing an open gate (~33K particles, ligand-bound open state) was selected and 3D refined to get an EM map of 3.7 \u00c5, and two other classes showing a closed gate (~56K particles, ligand-bound closed state) were selected and 3D refined to get an EM map of 3.4 \u00c5.\nTwo datasets were collected for the apo HsTPC2 sample. For dataset I, 101,354 particles were picked from 327 micrographs. After 2D classification, 86,560 particles were selected for 3D classification. For dataset II, 126,572 particles were picked from 368 micrographs. After 2D classification, 105,629 particles were selected for 3D classification. One class from 3D classification of dataset I (31, 973 particles) and two classes from 3D classification of dataset II (64, 388 particles) were combined for 3D auto-refinement and particle polishing, which resulted in a map with an overall resolution of 3.5 \u00c5.\nAll resolutions were estimated by applying a soft mask around the protein density and the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) = 0.143 criterion. ResMap was used to calculate the local resolution map (Kucukelbir et al., 2014).\nModel buildings were conducted in Coot (Emsley et al., 2010) and the MmTPC1 structure (PDB accession number 6C9A) was used as the reference. Amino acid assignments were also confirmed by the clearly defined densities for bulky residues (Phe, Trp, Tyr, and Arg). Real space model refinement (Afonine et al., 2018b) and validation(Afonine et al., 2018a) were performed in Phenix. Residues 1\u201338, 241\u2013251, 347\u2013353, 526\u2013538, 609\u2013619 and 702\u2013752 are disordered and not modeled in all states. The statistic of the models\u2019 geometries was generated using MolProbity (Chen et al., 2010). All figures were prepared using the software PyMol (RRID:SCR_000305, The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.8 Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC.) or Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004).\nIn human TPC2, the Leu11Ala and Leu12Ala mutations at the N-terminal targeting sequence have been shown to promote channel expression and trafficking to the plasma membrane of the HEK293 cell, allowing for channel activity measurement using patch clamp (Brailoiu et al., 2010; Jha et al., 2014). Therefore the Leu11Ala/Ile12Ala mutant was used and considered as the wild type channel in all our recordings. All other mutations in our experiments were generated on the background of this plasma membrane-targeting HsTPC2. With the channels targeted to the plasma membrane, the extracellular side is equivalent to the luminal side of HsTPC2 in endo/lysosomes. HsTPC2 and its mutants were cloned into pCS2 vector. About 2 \u00b5g of the plasmid containing the C-terminal GFP-tagged mouse TPC2 or its mutants was transfected into HEK293 cells grown in a six-well tissue culture dish using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 48 hr after transfection, cells were dissociated by trypsin treatment and kept in complete serum-containing media and re-plated on a 35 mm tissue culture dish and kept in a tissue culture incubator until recording. Similar transfections were done for expression test and subcellular localization experiments with the exception being 0.5 ug of the plasma membrane maker KRas GTPase tail tagged with mCherry was co-transfected with the HsTPC2 mutants for the subcellular localization experiments.\nPatch-clamp recordings in the whole-cell configuration or inside-out configuration (excised patch) were employed to measure channel activity. The standard intracellular solution contained (in mM): 145 Sodium methanesulfonate (Na-MS), 5 NaCl, 1 EGTA, 10 HEPES buffered with Tris, pH = 7.4. The extracellular solution contained (in mM): 145 Na-MS, 5 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES buffered with Tris, pH = 7.4. Various concentrations of PI(3,5)P2 as specified in each experiment were added to the intracellular solutions to activate the channel. For patches in the whole-cell configuration, the intracellular and extracellular solutions are defined as that in the pipette and the bath, respectively; the solution arrangement is reversed for the inside-out patch recordings. The lipid ligands used in our studies are phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate diC8 (PI(3,4)P2 diC8), phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate diC8 (PI(3,5)P2 diC8), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate diC8 (PI(4,5)P2 diC8), phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate diC8 (PI(3)P diC8), and phosphatidylinositol-5-sphosphate diC8 (PI(5)P diC8) (Echelon).\nElectrophysiology data were acquired using an AxoPatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices) and a low-pass analogue filter set to 1 kHz. The current signal was sampled at a rate of 20 kHz using a Digidata 1322A digitizer (Molecular Devices) and further analyzed with pClamp9 software (Molecular Devices). Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (Harvard Apparatus) and heat polished to a resistance of 3\u20135 M\u2126. After the patch pipette attached to the cell membrane, a giga seal (>10 G\u2126) was formed by gentle suction. The whole-cell configuration was formed by short zap or suction to rupture the patch. The inside-out configuration was formed by pulling pipette away from the cell, and the pipette tip was exposed into the air for short time in some cases. All I-V curves of HsTPC2 and its mutants were obtained using voltage pulses ramp from \u2212100 to +100 mV over 800 ms duration with the exception being the data for voltage activation shown in Figure 3D and E. In the voltage-dependent activation measurements of HsTPC2 and the HsTPC2 R551I mutant, the membrane was stepped from the holding potential (\u221270 mV) to various testing potentials (\u2212100 mV to +100 mV) for 1 s and then stepped to \u221270 mV. The current at the end of each testing potential was used to plot the I-V curve. All electrophysiological recordings were repeated at least five times using different patches. All data points are mean \u00b1 s.e.m. (n \u2265 5).\nThe cryo-EM density maps of HsTPC2 have been deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank under accession numbers EMD-0478 for the apo state, EMD-0477 for the PI(3,5)P2-bound open state and EMD-0479 for the PI(3,5)P2-bound closed state. Atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession numbers 6NQ1 for the apo state, 6NQ0 for the PI(3,5)P2-bound open state and 6NQ2 for the PI(3,5)P2-bound closed state.\nActa Crystallographica Section D Structural Biology 74:814\u2013840.\nActa Crystallographica Section D Structural Biology 74:531\u2013544.\nThe Journal of Cell Biology 186:201\u2013209.\nJournal of Biological Chemistry 285:38511\u201338516.\nThe Journal of Physiology 588:3179\u20133185.\nJournal of Biological Chemistry 289:4262\u20134272.\nJournal of Cell Science 128:232\u2013238.\nCellular and Molecular Life Sciences 75:3803\u20133815.\nJournal of Biological Chemistry 286:27875\u201327881.\nPfl\u00fcgers Archiv - European Journal of Physiology 458:891\u2013899.\nThank you for submitting your article \"Structural mechanisms of phospholipid activation of the human TPC2 channel\" for consideration by eLife.

The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Haoxing Xu (Reviewer #1); Alexander Sobolevsky (Reviewer #2); Vera Moiseenkova-Bell (Reviewer #3).\nTPC channels TPC1 and TPC2 are present in endolysosomal membranes and implicated in various physiological processes, including hair pigmentation, blood vessel formation and lipid metabolism. Determining structural bases of their architecture and gating is important not only for understanding the role of these channels in physiological processes but may also help developing new therapeutic strategies. She et al. present cryo-EM structures of human TPC2 in the apo and agonist (PIP2)-bound closed and open states. The same group has previously solved structures of TPC1 from Arabidopsis thaliana and mouse. While the structures and gating mechanisms of TPC1 and TPC2 are similar, there are significant subtype-specific differences, including the lack of TPC2 modulation by the membrane voltage, which undoubtedly warrant publication of these new results in eLife. The data presented is of high quality and the interpretations are just and fair.\nWe only have one essential suggestion: Density comparison analysis suggested that K203, K204 K207, S322, and R329 form the PI(3,5)P2-binding site(s), which was supported by the electrophysiology results on single mutations. Only EC50 values were provided. It would be most helpful if the hill slope (n) values are also provided for wild-type and mutant channels. If these mutations are indeed affect ligand-binding, but not gating or gating-binding coupling, it is likely that the n values are reduced. Of course it would be more convincing if the PI(3,5)P2 activation effect was abolished by double or triple mutations of K203/K204/K207, yet activation by another TPC agonist remains intact.\nThe Hill coefficient (n) values have been added in the revision (Figure 4F) as suggested. We actually noticed a slight increase in the Hill coefficient values for all the mutants. It is possible that the mutations also affect the coupling between gating and ligand binding. We did not test any double or triple mutations as single mutation at K203 or K204 already resulted in very small currents. We suspect that the double or triple mutations at K203/K204/K207 may not yield any measurable currents. We do not know of any agonist that can activate TPC channel independently of PI(3,5)P2.\nWe thank N Nguyen for manuscript preparation, and Dr. M X Zhu at University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston for providing clones of animal TPC genes.

You take decisions for the interactive thriller\u2019s hero while the movie keeps on running seamlessly. The app comes for free including one first, chapter-like episode. It allows you to get a feel for this unique cinematic experience yourself. Via one In-App-Purchase (IAP) you can then purchase the whole remaining film consisting of a total of 12 additional chapter-like episodes. You can play all episodes again and again and discover the countless storylines. THE STORY Matt, a smart student, has to prove his innocence after being forced into the robbery of a famous London auction house. How will he/you decide to act when everything is turning against him? You take decisions for Matt by simply touching buttons at decisive moments of the story. You\u2019re under the same time pressure as he is, and you\u2019ll only have a few seconds to decide. But you\u2019ll never know in advance what the best decision is. Some consequences will show up immediately after you\u2019ve decided, others only much later in the story. DECISIONS AND CONSEQUENCES \u2026 By touching objects such as keypads and computers in the movie, you can trigger additional decisions. Occasionally you can discover things in the movie by changing the camera perspective with swipe gestures. But basically you\u2019re still watching a movie. So you\u2019ll see real people and experience human emotions in a superior production-value movie shot entirely on original locations in London. A NEW CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE \u2026 Will you be able to guide Matt out of his desperate situation? It\u2019s in your hands whether Matt adopts the brave and difficult path to redemption, or not. Naturally, not all of the seven endings are pleasant. So you\u2019ll have to live with the consequences of yours and Matt\u2019s actions. ADDICTIVE MOBILE ENTERTAINMENT \u2026 \u2022 The average length of this unique interactive experience is similar to a feature-length movie but it offers a total of more than four hours of film. In order to fully explore the countless storylines, you can play it through as many times as you want and you\u2019ll learn more each time. \u2022 The film is in English language. You can choose English, French, German and Italian subtitles, which also changes the language of the buttons used for decision making. \u2022 The app comes for free including a first, chapter-like episode. It allows you to get a feel for this unique cinematic experience yourself before purchasing the whole film via In-App-Purchase (IAP). \u2022 A download manager allows you to either download the entire movie at once or separated in chapter-like episodes (each having a data size from 149 MB to 603 MB). You can of course also delete already watched episodes without losing your progress. Your Decisions Are You.\nI hooked my iPad up to a TV and played/watched with a friend. Was a lot of fun that way.

With lots of options, bright viewfinders, and autofocus, the Spectra System and Spectra AF cameras are solid workhorses.\nBoth the Polaroid Spectra System and Spectra AF are very similar cameras, despite having slightly different bodies, so I\u2019m combining them into one guide. The guts of the camera, along with the controls, viewfinder, and lens, are practically identical. The main difference is the Spectra AF\u2019s plastic body is a bit curvier, and the handle is also made of hard plastic. From here on, I will use \u2018Spectra System\u2019 to refer to both cameras.\nThere are also variants of these cameras with different names that have much more limited controls. For this guide, we\u2019re going to be looking at the cameras that have a full array of switches and autofocus. I\u2019ll have a separate guide for the simpler cameras like the 1200i out soon.\nWhat Film Does the Polaroid Spectra System Use?\nBefore we get started, we need to make sure you have the film you\u2019ll need for the camera. The Polaroid Spectra System uses a type of Polaroid film that\u2019s slightly wider than the classic 600/SX-70 square frame. This film is interchangeably called Spectra, Type 1200, and Image.\nPolaroid discontinued Spectra/1200/Image film way back in 2008, but a company called the Impossible Project rose up and started making new film for the camera. In 2017, the Impossible Project renamed itself \u2018Polaroid Originals,\u2019 and continues making new film for vintage Polaroid cameras.\nPolaroid Originals film for Spectra is what you\u2019ll need to operate the camera. The Polaroid Spectra System is powered by a small battery in the film cartridge itself, so it won\u2019t even turn on until you load a new pack of film. I\u2019ll go over how to load the camera below, but before we get started, make sure you have a fresh pack of film in hand.\nYou can order Polaroid Originals Spectra film from Amazon and B&H, as well as directly from Polaroid Originals.\nFuji Instax film, and Polaroid Originals film for iType, SX-70, and 600 will not work with this camera. Also, old packs of vintage Polaroid Spectra or Spectra Soft Tone film will likely have a dead battery. The film is often still good, but you\u2019ll need to do a battery transfer, and are still going to need a fresh pack of film to do so.\nThe switch on the side that opens and closes the camera.\nOne of the best features of the Spectra System is that it collapses into a fairly compact shape for storage. This protects the lens and lets the camera take up a bit less space in storage.\nTo turn the camera on and pop it open, push forward the lever on the side, just below the handle. When not using the camera, you can shut it off and close it with the same lever.\nIf the camera is loaded with fresh film film, one of the status LEDs on the back of the camera will light up when the camera is turned on. If the lights do not come on and there is new film in the camera, try waking it by tapping the shutter down halfway. If nothing works, try a different pack of film.\nIf there is no film in the camera, it will not turn on. The battery that runs the camera is in the film cartridge itself.\nComponents on the front of the Spectra System camera.\nControl panel on the back of the camera.\nUnit switch: This switch isn\u2019t meant to be used often, so it\u2019s recessed so it doesn\u2019t accidentally get changed. Basically, it changes the readout in the viewfinder to switch between using feet or meters as a measurement. Use a pen or paperclip to change it.\nSounds: Turns on or off camera beeps. I hate camera blips and beeps, so I always turn this off.\nTimer: To shoot with the timer, trigger it by switching it down and hit the shutter. The camera will count down to taking a picture, giving you time to get into frame. The camera will take 12 seconds before taking the picture. Strangely, the camera will not eject the picture until after you switch the timer trigger back up, I assume to make sure you don\u2019t accidentally do it twice.\nAutofocus on/off: When turning off autofocus, you don\u2019t really have the ability to \u2018manually\u2019 focus. Instead, it simply leaves the camera at infinity. Just about the only scenario that this is helpful is when you\u2019re trying to shoot through a window and the sonar autofocus keeps getting tripped up by the glass.\nFlash on/off: Turns the flash on or off. Polaroid film needs tons of light to expose properly, so unless you\u2019re outside on a bright, sunny day, or are using incredibly powerful continuous studio lighting, you\u2019re going to need to keep the flash on.\nExposure compensation: Push it up to lighten the image, and push it down to darken the image. With practice, you\u2019ll get a feel for the camera\u2019s exposure patterns, and know how to use this. Most of the time, however, the camera does pretty well with it right in the middle, where I leave it.\nThese controls don\u2019t automatically reset back to their defaults when turning the camera on and off, so make sure to do a check before getting started. I\u2019ve gotten in trouble in the past when I fire off a frame with the flash off and MF on and completely waste a shot.\nPush down on this switch to open the film cartridge compartment.\nTo load film into the Spectra System, first open the camera. Then, on the opposite side from the open/close switch, there is another switch on the side that is accessible when the camera is open. Push down on it, and the front flap opens, revealing the film compartment.\nRemove the old pack of film (if there is one) by pulling it out by the tab attached to the cartridge. Insert a new pack of film by pushing it in through the same slot. The \u2018wide\u2019 end with the plastic lip should face out, with the darkslide facing up and the metal contacts facing down.\nOnce the film is fully inserted, you\u2019ll be able to shut the film compartment. As soon as it locks into place, the camera should eject a darkslide out the front. This lets you know that the film pack works, and the Spectra System is ready to go.\nLooking through the viewfinder. The red number at the bottom lets you know what distance the camera has focused, which is extremely helpful.\nWhen the film is loaded, or the camera is turned on, simply wait for the LED to turn green to signify that the flash is charged and ready to use. Look through the viewfinder to compose, and press down halfway on the shutter to focus.\nThe viewfinder is still a rangerfinder, meaning that you\u2019re looking through a window separate from the lens. You won\u2019t be able to \u2018see\u2019 how the camera is focusing, but you will get an incredibly helpful readout that tells you how many meters or feet away the camera is focusing before you shoot. This gives you a heads up that the camera may think a chair two feet away is the subject, when you\u2019re actually trying to shoot a landscape at infinity.\nIf the camera detects focus within range of your subject (it usually does, sonar autofocus works pretty darn well), press down all the way on the shutter to take the picture.\nI have a whole article about how to scan your Polaroid images, and once you get them digitized, you can share them online!", "version": "v0"}

This visualization experiment illustrates a mechanism for highlighting these connections.\nThe wavelengths presented are: 617.3nm optical light from SDO/HMI. From SDO/AIA we have 170nm (pink), then 160nm (green), 33.5nm (blue), 30.4nm (orange), 21.1nm (violet), 19.3nm (bronze), 17.1nm (gold), 13.1nm (aqua) and 9.4nm (green).\nWe've locked the camera to rotate the view of the Sun so each wedge-shaped wavelength filter passes over a region of the Sun. As the features pass from one wavelength to the next, we can see dramatic differences in solar structures that appear in different wavelengths.\nFilaments extending off the limb of the Sun which are bright in 30.4 nanometers, appear dark in many other wavelengths.\nSunspots which appear dark in optical wavelengths, are festooned with glowing ribbons in ultraviolet wavelengths.\nSmall flares, invisible in optical wavelengths, are bright ribbons in ultraviolet wavelengths.\nIf we compare the visible light limb of the Sun with the 170 nanometer filter on the left, with the visible light limb and the 9.4 nanometer filter on the right, we see that the 'edge' is at different heights. This effect is due to the different amounts of absorption, and emission, of the solar atmosphere in ultraviolet light.\nIn far ultraviolet light, the photosphere is dark since the black-body spectrum at a temperature of 5700 Kelvin emits very little light in this wavelength.\nThe movie opens with a full-disk view of the Sun in visible wavelengths. Then the filters are applied to small pie-shaped wedges of the Sun, starting with 170nm (pink), then 160nm (green), 33.5nm (blue), 30.4nm (orange), 21.1nm (violet), 19.3nm (bronze), 17.1nm (gold), 13.1nm (aqua) and 9.4nm (green).

We know that each school/kura decides how they are going to use Arinui but these tips are too good not to share with others. We hope that they will help make educators' first experience with Arinui really powerful.\nUnpack the Standards for the Teaching Profession considering what they look like in your context. Build shared understanding about what they mean for you. Work through the Quality Practice Template.\nCo-construct expectations about how Arinui is going to be used at your place. What are the must dos? What sources of evidence have to be integrated within Arinui?\nCreate a time frame which outlines these expectations, or adapt the one provided in Arinui (see \"Getting the best out of Arinui\"). Add this to the \"our resources\" section on Arinui so all teachers and leaders can access it.\nDecide what counts as strong and supporting evidence against the standards. Be guided by the clarification from the Education Council of Aotearoa New Zealand.\nReiterate that the focus is on improving, not just proving.\nMake sure all staff are clear that it is about providing good quality evidence, not mountains of evidence!\nAllocate time during existing meeting structures for Arinui.\nEnsure that your language of professional dialogue and learning is about improving practice.\nBuild time for formal and informal professional conversations about practice.\nTalk about how you are using Arinui with your colleagues and encourage others to do the same.\nMeet with the designated appraisers to clarify their role in a teacher-led appraisal model.\nUse the Maia exemplar provided by Arinui: to moderate the appraisal decisions that your team would make, and to role-play informal and formal appraisal conversations the appraisers would have, using her collection as evidence.\nUpskill in Open-to-Learning conversations. Seek additional support on this if required.\nIf you have an external appraiser, they can be easily added into your school's Arinui zone. Let us know if you'd like this to happen by emailing info@arinui.com.\nThis is your first year with Arinui. Don't expect all staff to be 100% perfect with it. Use your first year to figure out exactly how it is going to work in your context.\nAlign your current processes and how you'll use Arinui to enable teacher-led appraisal.\nUse the skill set of your staff to support each other - if you have a whiz with uploading videos, managing different sources of evidence or analysing data, see if they are happy to support their colleagues.\nIt is incredibly difficult to 'break' Arinui. Contact us if you are stuck.\nCheck in with your staff each term about their experiences with Arinui. What is better as a result of using Arinui? Are there roadblocks for your staff? If so what are they? Collate their responses to see if there is a shift over time.\nCheck in to see whether your staff are regularly reflecting on their practice in Arinui.\nBe open to hearing if things aren't going well - not everything is going to run perfectly in your first year.\nGive feedback to the Arinui team. Your feedback helps us refine Arinui so it is better than before.\nRevisit your initial school-wide expectations and revise these if necessary after your first appraisal cycle.\nFind out more about Arinui.", "version": "v0"}

The inspiration comes from, among other things, Xbox Kinect, which interprets specific gestures without the use of a game controller, making hands-free control possible.\nLarge interactive displays have become an integrated part of our everyday lives. Whether at home, at work or in a public place, large displays are starting to appear everywhere. While the displays allow for interactive content, the interaction techniques are still lacking behind. Especially typing text on these interactive displays is challenging. The award winning paper explores how text entry is possible by drawing the words as gestures in the air in front of the user.\nThe work can prove valuable in many different contexts. Amongst others, doctors could be able to interact with computers during surgery without using a physical keyboard or a touchscreen keyboard, thus minimizing the risk of a bacterial infection that could jeopardize the health and safety of patients.\nThere are plenty of other possible applications of Vulture, says Anders Markussen, but right now, the first challenge is to improve the text-entry rate. While the text-entry rate is not bad, he continues, it still cannot compete with a classic keyboard or a touchscreen.\nThe Vulture project is an offshoot of the WallViz project that is looking into the use of wall-sized, interactive displays.", "version": "v0"}

Dazzling views all the way there and a stop off at Cardrona Hotel for full effect. I\u2019ve cobbled together my faves for you if you have one, two or (lucky you) three days.\nHead straight for Federal Diner for their bacon and egg butty and awesome coffee to get you started. If the weather is pants (that\u2019s rubbish in my language) a spot of shopping is great. 47 Frocks, Gifted, Outside Sports, Wilson & Dorset, Alice to start you off. There\u2019s heaps of shops hidden away in the little malls and side streets so get wandering and keep your eyes peeled. Lunch at Relishes or Kai Whaka Pai and if you\u2019ve a car you can\u2019t miss a wander up Mount Iron (just a short drive out of town). On the way back in head to Good Rotations and check out their bikes (and a coffee at The Good Spot Caravan) and then shoot over to Kika for dinner or The White House.\nA moonlit wander along the beach to finish.\nSee Day One and then add in a trip out to Glendhu Bay, either by car or start the wandering along the Millennium Track. If you have the inclination you can ride or run there but a small jaunt towards it is good enough (it\u2019s 15k one way). If you\u2019re driving keep going after Glendhu Camp Ground (check out the view of Mount Aspiring on the way) and see the gorgeous green crystal clear water of all the bays along the way all the way out to Treble Cone.\nAnother must do is Mou Waho. An island in a lake on an island in the lake (you\u2019ll understand when you get there) is one of my absolute favourite things to do with Eco Wanaka Adventures. They\u2019ll explain about the island, the work they\u2019re doing out there, the fact they have Weka there (extinct on the mainland) and it\u2019s one of the most mindblowingly beautiful places on the planet. Don\u2019t believe me? You will.\nA bite at Florence\u2019s (for lunch in the middle of the day) and then dinner- a trip to The Landing for dinner looking out at the mountains. You can also sample crepes at Charlie Browns. I already did for you so you\u2019re welcome!\nSee day one and two. Head to Big Fig for some coffee and brekkie and a wander along Lakeside Road on the trail and snap at Black Peak. After Black Peak get yourself to another Black Peak (Black Peak Gelato) this time for some of the best ice-cream this side of the hill. Coconut is my go to. They have all the flavours for you to drool about on the board outside.\nAfter out to Oakridge for a dip in their hot pools and swimming pool. Total relaxation. Bad weather day check out Paradiso Cinema for a gorgeous unique experience, or get all cozy a short drive out to Cardrona Hotel (nachos all the way). They have roaring fires and mulled wine in Winter, outdoor alfresco dining in Summer).\nI love Wanaka and would love to know \u2018your\u2019 Wanaka!

Known as famous \"King\" Kenny, He is a multiple winner and three-time champion in the class 500cc. Since childhood - he got training and employment in motocross. \"Junior\" took the path of his father, was a racer, his path to the top was more simple than that of his father: from the cradle to the paddock, racing was in his blood. The fourth title in the family - He is the another proof of that.\n1990 - debut in a road-racing circuit in the 250cc - 5 wins.\n1993 - 2nd place in the Spanish league Ducados Open 250cc for Yamaha; debut in the World Championship in the 250cc \"Junior\" is released on the wild-card in the U.S. Grand Prix home race for the team his father, the tenth place! The season starts with an 8-hour race Suzuka 8H: 8th place!\nRoberts began his career with the team in the GP250 Wayne Rainey and Yamaha in the last four races of the season. Three finish in the points, including the eighth place in the Grand Prix of the United States and the sixth-largest in Argentina. 23 points and 18 place in the four races!\nFull season in the GP250: 8th place and 82 points as a result of the season, all the races were finished in the top ten. Best results: fifth place in Assen and Barcelona, \u200b\u200bthe fourth in Germany.\nKenny Sr. starts his own project in MotoGP - KR Team with a motorcycle of his own design, and 3-cylinder engine KR3. \"Junior\" invited and refuses. Results are given with difficulty, but Kenny manages to complete a few races in the TOP-8 and earn 37 points. 16th place for the season.\nInvitation to join the Suzuki factory team gives Kenny a chance to discover their full potential with a very competitive bike and strong team. And he does it. In the first two races, Kenny wins in a tough fight with a pair of Honda as part of Mick and Alex Duyena curve. The fall and departure from the scene means Dwayne Roberts duel and curves. American wins two more races, total - four (Malaysia, Japan, Germany, and Argentina), then completes another 9 races in the TOP-6. Earn 220 points and silver up to the season.\nStellar year for \"Junior.\" Suzuki gets a new sponsor in the form of a rich Movistar, but Honda is not so strong makes it possible for them to leave. This is the best chance for a bright shining star Roberts Junior. In 13 races, he will start with the first line, 9 times on the podium, winning four. Valentino Rossi is only in the championship and learns to ride a 500-cc motorcycle, but has already won two races. Only Roberts confidently to victory in the season and he earns it: the first and only title he dedicated to his father, he earns 258 points.\nThe year of triumph, the year of the failure. And mostly the fault of Suzuki: to defend the title on RGV500 became impossible, Honda and Yamaha woke up and brought their racing prototypes to mind. This season, Roberts is only three times in the first starting line, and the season ends with a few finishes in the top six. Podium in Valencia, but in a race won Seth Gibernau, who correctly picks up the rain tires in this battle. 11th place and just 97 points for the year.\nIn 2002, the same thing happens, but Suzuki decided to completely redo its new 990-cc four-stroke prototypes. Roberts takes on the mission of the developer and tester. Invariably, Honda and Yamaha ahead, GSV-R takes Kenny to fourth in Portugal, and in Brazil in third. Earned points in 11 races was enough to finish the season in 9th place.\nSuzuki began the season without a title sponsor, and in their own corporate colors. Of course, this could not affect the results. The second line of the start in Japan, but in ninth place in Australia - Kenny Roberts all the achievements this season. The team leaves for the winter holidays with a clear knowledge of what and how to change a motorcycle.\nKenny is still with Suzuki, for the sixth consecutive season. Work in full swing: the new GSV-R has changed a lot over the winter. Roberts is a partner young but full of promise, John Hopkins. Roberts draws 18th place in the Championship, but the results are far from the same: only 4 finish in the top ten and one pole position (in Brazil). The new team manager Paul Denning intended to change the situation and find new motivation for the riders. Kenny is in the team and the next, in 2005.\nA decisive year for \"Junior\": Denning changes MANAGEMENT team begins a search of new blood, while beginning to show themselves, and John Hopkins. Only two finish in the top ten, and one an incredible podium at Donington impel Roberts to suggest that really must be going. However, the development GSV-R is the direct participation of riders, so to the last races of the season Kenny \"in deeds.\" The situation is changing wrist injury that Kenny gets in training Australian Grand Prix. Fracture finally knocks rider out of the rut. Not waiting for the end of the season, Kenny says about leaving the team. This is a difficult but necessary decision: Roberts and Suzuki MotoGP become virtually synonymous in the last decade.", "version": "v0"}

Not only is it a great fun, but it allows you to spend more quality time with your family, friends or colleagues.\nIf you\u2019re considering buying a foosball table, you\u2019ve come to a right place. Game Amigos prepared an unbiased ultimate buying guide, considered over 30 products and reviewed the 9 best foosball tables on the market in 2019.\nIf you don\u2019t have time to read all the reviews, here are the TOP 3 foosball tables \u2013 one from the budget category, the overall best foosball table on the market (our top pick) and one from the professional tables category.\nSelecting the right foosball table is no rocket science, but there are certain things you should think about prior to the purchase. In that way, you won\u2019t have to regret your decision and you\u2019ll enjoy your foosball table for a long period of time.\nIn the following foosball table reviews, we have considered the most importnat factors and analyzed and compared 10 best models to make your decision-making process easier.\nWarrior Professional foosball table is ideal for those looking for a balance between professional table and a good price. It offers professional level features and security measures that turn it into a friendly option for players of any age.\nWith a simple, yet elegant design, this table gives an advanced game experience that is achieved through high-quality split bearings, allowing much faster and powerful shots that roll through a slightly textured 56 inches playing surface. The sturdy foot levelers automatically reduce any unwanted shakiness during games.\nThis table features unique rod guards that noticeably increase the safety of the game and make it great for young participants. That gives children the opportunity to play without the need of constant supervision.\nWarrior Professional is endorsed by the ITSF & USTSF and has a 1 year warranty. The construction manual is not very good, but the process of setting up this 195 lbs table is much easier thanks to the \u201cno assembly\u201d rods.\nThis foosball table has only a single goalie set-up, which isn\u2019t necessarily a terrible thing but does increase the difficulty a little. Players will be forced to work on their goalkeeping skills, which we consider fair for a table that can work for tournaments at a non-tournament-grade table price.\nHathaway Playoff foosball table is our best budget option. It has an eye-catching, bright, colorful design and features that contribute to a more realistic game experience for a surprising price.\nMade out of medium-density fibreboard (CARB certified MDF), this is an easy to carry table that weights 53.4 pounds. It can be very convenient for those who are short of space thanks to its smaller-than-standard dimensions (48.5\u201d L x 24\u201d W x 32\u201d H).\nDespite the 40-inch playing surface, this table is still a good option for adults who are comfortable with a more compact game experience. The setup process is relatively easy, so it shouldn\u2019t take longer than an hour to put it together.\nThe Playoff foosball table by Hathaway features a 3-goalie set-up and includes an abacus-style simple scoring system that helps to keep up with the pace of intense matches. Ergonomic handles ensure steady grip and we appreciate the reinforced legs with easy-to-adjust levelers too.\nOne of the disadvantages is quite short warranty (only 6 months). The steel rods are thinner compared to other tables and may bend over time if the table is used too intensely. However, one must remember the price level of this table, which make this model a good quality table for the money.\nThe very best professional foosball table in this ultimate guide is the Tornado Sport Foosball Table. It is a great option for anyone serious about foosball \u2013 from beginners and enthusiasts to advanced players and professionals.\nWeighing 225 pounds and showcasing a 1\u2033thick cabinet of solid wood, the heaviness of the Tornado surprisingly exceeds our requirements. The construction is very sturdy and reliable, ready to hold up the pressure of even the most energetic matches.\nThe fine looks of this table can be attributed to its light brown handles (made out of wood) which contrast with the dark body of the table. Black leather laminate finish and quality wood construction ensure durability and give this table a natural look that can blend into any type of room. It may not be as appealing compared to tables with brighter designs, but it really depends on the design and style preferences of each person.\nThe only con that we found is that the foosball men are not counterbalanced, but this is not such a big problem as the table offers only a 3-goalie setup. The previously mentioned features plus the fact that it\u2019s made by a trusted manufacturer, make this versatile, standard-sized table (56 inches) a great option for all the players serious about foosball.\nThe Best Choice Products foosball table is another low-price item listed in this guide. Attractive style and price, and that due to its height (33\u201d) both kids and adults can have all the fun foosball can bring.\nThis is a light-weighted table of 42 lbs, and even though it has only 45 inches in length, up to 4 players can play at the same time. This and the fact that it includes two cup holders on each end make this table perfect choice for social occasions.\nConstructed from medium density fiberboard, it features two chrome finished steel rods that increase the stability during games. The comfortable grips for the rod bars and smooth, friction-less field improve ball control so players can direct their focus on scoring. If the instructions are followed carefully, it can be (very) easy to assemble.\nThere\u2019s a missing star for this table because it has only a 2-month warranty and it isn\u2019t very heavy, which makes it less durable than its more expensive counterparts. Nevertheless, we think it offers great value for its price and is definitely a nice option if you\u2019re looking for an affordable source of fun for the whole family.\nThe Ambassador by Kick is an elegant foosball table suitable for both kids and adults. It\u2019s a great choice for anyone looking for a reasonably-priced foosball table with great value for money.\nWith a plush mahogany finish and stainless steel chrome plated rods, the Ambassador features thick cabinet and a 1/2\u2033 thick playing field similar to the ones that can only be found on professional foosball tables, providing a solid foosball game experience.\nThis 55- inches long table has a 1-goalie or 3-goalie setup and includes no-slip wooden handles that ensure reliability through intense plays.\nThe ball can return back to the field if you score the goal with great force, but this little malfunction can be fixed easily by making the wall behind the goalie softer. Ambassador foosball table has a set of 26 counterbalanced, uniformed foosball men that let players focus on improving their agility and better manage their skills.\nSome of the other advantages are lifetime warranty and a free rod lubricant shipped by the manufacturer upon request. All these nice features make this table an amazing choice for both the little ones and the grownups.\nWhat a design! We\u2019re glad to see models with not so traditional look enter the market. This model might be a an awesome pick for more modern room setting. The best part? The design decisions didn\u2019t compromise the quality or playability at all! Legs still have levelers as a quality table should have. Perfect choice for both adults and kids!\nKick Legend foosball table is our favorite model and the top pick among the best foosball tables we review in this guide. It is made of durable medium density fiberboard with a fine wood grain look and ebony legs. Thanks to this, the table has the versatility of complementing various types of home d\u00e9cor styles.\nThe table offers a precise control of players thanks to no-slip wooden handles and counterbalanced men. The leg levelers are a convenient feature for uneven floors and a 1 or 3-goalie setup lets you have the freedom of choosing your preferred way to play.\nAt times the ball may return back after scoring a goal too hard, which may be a little annoying. This issue is quite common among foosball tables, but it can be fixed easily by taping a piece of carton to the wall behind the foosball goal. Other than that (and a little complicated instruction manual), there are no other issues with this model.\nThe standard size (55\u201d length) of this table makes it a great option for kids, teens and adults at the same time. Together with an unlimited lifetime warranty by the manufacturer, we consider Legend by Kick to have the best value for money among the foosball tables on the market.\nThe Kick Royalton foosball table is a beautiful-looking piece that will complement any game room and add a slightly luxurious feel to it. It is also perfect for social occasions, and versatile for different kinds of players.\nBuilt out of durable wood composite, the body of this table features 4 integrated chrome-painted cup holders and 1-goalie or 3-goalie construction.\nThe Royalton foosball table gives a more solid game experience through sturdy 5\u2033 leg levelers that have a rubber bottom, decreasing the chances of it slipping during the game. The 1/2\u2033 thick and 55 inches long table offers a side ball return on each side for a more versatile game experience.\nOne of the main disadvantages of the table is its weight (only 103.3 pounds) especially for this price range. Some plastic elements of the table are not very attractive and the players and not counterbalanced.\nDespite these cons, the table provides stable matches, the lifetime warranty and excellent, prompt customer support typical for Kick.\nThe Hathaway Primo foosball table offers a surprising blend of high-quality performance and superior overall design that make players truly experience what a classic foosball game looks and feels like, regardless of how old they are.\nThis 136.7 lbs table features an espresso finish body built from CARB certified medium density fiberboard, stainless steel rods and integrated 5\u2033 chrome-finished leg levelers with rubber pads to prevent floor damage.\nThe high-quality and long lasting construction delivers a steady game experience.\nThe table includes two silver-toned analog scoring units and handles made out of solid wood.\nRegarding the disadvantages, the corner plates of the table are made from plastic and the warranty lasts only 6 months. Some people may not like that it features only a 1-goalie configuration, but we don\u2019t think it is a big problem.\nThere are some nice features too \u2013 4 integrated stainless steel cup holders and counterbalanced foosball men. Other pros include 46.5-inch playing field coated for a glossy, more realistic look to resemble a real soccer field and a higher ball velocity.\nThe Harvil Beachcomber foosball table gives a stylish first impression as a standard sized (56 inches) indoor atble that displays a wood grain finish. It gives a warm feel with a more rustic design while also offering quality craftsmanship.\nThis is a very solid table that weighs 138.85 lbs and is built out of quality wood covered with polyresin for better resistance against wear and use. This contributes to the solid durability of the table. The thick legs of the Beachcomber include levelers for a steady and balanced game experience.\nThis table offers a beautiful look but has also been constructed with the player\u2019s comfort in mind. It includes 4 drink holders and comfortable octagonal rubber handles to get a better grip and easy control of the foosball men.\nThe Beachcomber by Harvil has steel foosball rods that are rust-resistant. Some plastic parts, on the other hand, do not look very durable (especially the abacus). The instruction manual is not the best either.\nIt has a 1-year warranty and a 3-goalie setup ideal for foosball beginners.\nWhat to consider when buying a foosball table?\nWhether you\u2019re looking for a new hobby or you\u2019re just looking for a way to spend your free time with your friends or family, a quality foosball table can be a very enjoyable, entertaining and inclusive add to your home, an event or celebration, and so much more!\nAlso, the amount of benefits that a foosball table can bring to a workplace is, without any doubt, surprising.\nThere are lots of types of soccer tables to fit the needs of the variety of players out there. We reveal the must-have features that any high-quality foosball table should include for you to keep in mind and ultimately get the most fun out of it.\nNone of the things that need to be considered when buying a foosball table is as important as the weight of the table. If we wanted to simplify the whole process of selecting the best foosball table, we could say \u2013 the heavier the better.\nWhy? Well, one of the top things that a foosball table should offer is stability, especially during intense matches, since the last thing that you would want is for it to shift its position or have to level it repeatedly.\nAlthough foosball may look like a calm, peaceful sport that does not require any rough movements, the reality is quite the opposite and everyone who ever took part in an intense foosball game knows what we are talking about.\nAll the pressure against the table during the game may have a significant impact on its durability \u2013 over time, the screws and rods may become loose and the legs, once steady, may become wobbly.\nIn order to get a stable foosball table that you and your friends can rely on in any game, you should be looking at the heavier models (ideally more than 120 pounds) with thick legs made out of a high-quality, durable material.\nOf course, the weight of the table comes hand in hand with the materials that were used to build it. A sturdy solid wood panel is definitely heavier than a fiberboard. If you want to buy a quality foosball table that will last longer that a couple of games, you should look for one that is built with quality materials.\nThe best material is wood (for the body of the table), but the solid wood is quite pricey too. Due to this reason, many tables are built from composite lumber (a mixture of wood and other components such as resin), which is a great replacement for solid wood.\nA typical example is a medium density fibreboard (MDF) which is the most commonly used material for foosball tables.\nOne of the advantages is that they may be actually more resilient against humidity and moisture than solid wood.\nMDF is also resistant to termites and more eco-friendly, as it is made from recycled wood.\nTo prevent slippery hands from making the game hard or not letting someone win a fair game, choosing handles made out of wood or quality plastic will definitely help. This material will also improve your technique by giving you a much stronger grip and make you a more agile player.\nTruth is, if you\u2019re serious about attempting to make strong winning shots, you\u2019ll want to make sure that nothing stops you from doing so, and considering wood over cheap plastic handles can make you stop worrying about this type of issues from interfering with your game.\nFoosball tables come in different shapes and sizes. They are usually differentiated by the length of the table, from the 48-inches long tables, better suited for smaller rooms and occasional players, to professional 55 or 56 inches long tables.\nFrom our experience, the standard 55\u201d or 56\u201d table is the best choice as it offers the best playing experience while keeping the game challenging enough so that the match does not end too quickly after scoring all the goals within few seconds.\nWarranty \u2013 how long does it last?\nOne of the most important factors to consider when buying a foosball table (or any product for that matter) is the warranty by the manufacturer. Even the best foosball table can break down, and you should think about it when looking for one.\nThe warranty periods may range from a couple of months to unlimited lifetime warranties. We would recommend to go for at least 1-year-long warranty period for your foosball table.\nThere are two possible setups regarding the goalies \u2013 a 1-goalie setup or 3-goalies setup. Three-man goalie tables are more common in the US and they contribute to a faster game. The single goalie, on the other hand, is the original setup typical for European foosball tables and it requires more skilled goalkeeper.\nIn our opinion, the goalie setup doesn\u2019t really make a huge difference in the game experience so it should not be the most important factor that decides which table you choose. The truth is that you will get used to any of these two types very quickly.\nOf course, it is great if you can try both setups and decide which one do you prefer more. Some table manufacturers (Kick for example) provide both options within their models.\nAlthough this feature may seem like nothing too important, it is a nice little addition that can improve your overall game experience. The advantage of counter-balanced men is that they stay in the horizontal position anytime you position them like that.\nOn the other hand, a well-positioned goalie and defensive rod might save the day when a counterattack comes all of a sudden.\nThis may sound like a very detailed or unnecessary requirement, but if you\u2019ve played foosball in the past, one thing that you probably hate is when you have to hold the handle constantly in order to keep the players in the desired position.\nBy making sure that the weight below and over the rod is balanced, you\u2019ll be able to play a much smoother game, get and maintain your focus on the moves that you should do to win.\nContrary to what some may think, table football isn\u2019t just a game for kids, and among the many positive things that playing it carries, you\u2019ll find that it is a great way to distract yourself from the routine and have some fun with the ones around you.\nPrioritizing these must-haves will make you live the experience and truly enjoy the benefits a high-quality foosball table can bring.

Check out this ring also.\nDiscussion in 'Barbarian' started by ProjectHate, Nov 15, 2006.\nHi, so now that i got this ring - 10 cast,20 str,116 ar,8 lr,22pr,15 mf ring I have 30 cast on my barb since im using arachnids.How much cast will I be needing to reach a frame over using arachnids along with 2x ravenfrosts , is it just 30 or will I be needing another cast ring?\nOh and I'd like the good bvc's opinion on this ring,I'll be using it along with coa ,this way it wont pop again.\nHmm I just remembered I wanted to say I purchased the ring for 2 pally combat gc's on west ladder , I came back to d2 after a month and saw runes went way down on west ladder so I just told him pcombats were 10 runes each and went with the flow next thing you know he traded.\nHmm I need some answers ^-^ thanks.\nAdvice - most of the time 20fcr from arach is enough.\nFor an FCR ring yes, but for an overall ring not. It will allow Hsarus + CoA + Grief + Beast + Fortitude.\nI was refering to a general setup - str/fcr ring can be used for some custom setups, of course.\nthe bad thing about hsarus +forti is that one really loses easy desynch ability . i tested and looks like with that set up 10% frw loss from gores is crucial , and my desynch gets seriosly crippled. Gores + fortitude = much easier desynch than fortitude + hsarus. You will desynch with hsarus too but it requires longer ww's which puts the barb at risk since the better hammerdins and smiters will be able to easyly predict where to place themselves for nice hits on you.\nWho the hell cares for a damn about desynch versus Smiters? It's not like a good smiter will even let you desynch. And I know this based on dueling the two probably best paladin players on Europe. Goldwrap, the best smiter, and Ben, the best V/T and anti-barbarian player. From what I hear, even Morotsjos loses to Ben.\nBesides, why would you need fcr with fort on?\nAnd... Fort has Faster Cast!\nI said the FCR is not needed. The ring would be used plainly for the +20 str. Of course, if you manage to get something like 10fcr/20str/90mana/120ar/11allres/blahblah, you should be using it.\nyou are wrong as usual.\nHuh, I'm using the ring for cast and str in order to use coa with 40 str beast+grief so it wont POP again.\nWrong about what? I heard from my friend that Ben beats you. Blame him, not me.\nAs for Goldwrap and Ben being the best, I doubt even with this time anyone could've even come close to their level of skill.\nyes thats all great but the fact remains cast and str are both needed on this ring in order to use coa without adding str.\nyou're talking out of your ***. as usual. desynch is what makes it possible for barbs to win vs smiters at all. desynch is needed to counter telesmite/positioning via desynched charge. even though karol still is the best desyncher (and most entertaining smiter in general) i've seen there are a bunch of smiters who are better at killing barbs. the fact that _you_ haven't met any means nothing. although you seem incapable of ceasing your notorious namedropping please dont mention me in any of your retarded posts again. ever.\nAnd thus you will end up being incapable to switching any rings at all. Except for 1 ring at a time.\nwell say what u guys want but bottom line is u need frw and desync vs a good tele smiter, hence why u usally get eaten when u use a forti setup vs a tele smiter which is even worst with hf flashing.\nThe closest equivelent to this is either to spend extra points in str so u can wear that coa or i use a realm belt and use trangs for fcr when needed.\nUpped Gore Riders str. Req.: 156 <--- As much desynch as you'd ever want.\nAnd how do you plan to use Fortitude + CoA along with Hsarus? By adding an extra 20 to STR and thus losing 191 life? No thanks.", "version": "v0"}

In modeling disease likelihood in patients, statisticians may utilize logistic regression to estimate the appropriate weights for each input variable, which correspond to disease characteristics. Neural networks are useful when the interactions between disease characteristics are complex and manifold.\nTo accommodate the interactions between disease features, neural networks often employ a layer of \u201chidden features,\u201d and each layer depends on the features of the preceding layer. The network must identify which features are currently \u201cactive\u201d in a case to determine the presence of disease. To parse out an appropriate set of hidden features, neural networks must repeatedly modify the weights of connections from input variables to hidden factors and from hidden factors to output variables.\nIntroduced in 1986, the \u201cback-propagation\u201d procedure allows neural networks to adjust these weights by \u201cpropagating\u201d discrepancies between network output and target output through each connection and its respective weight.3 Per this procedure, neural networks substantially outperform learning done via trial-and-error.4 Convolutional neural networks expand upon the concept of hidden factors by making a separate copy of each feature detector for each position in the image. After the weights for each copy are updated through back-propagation, the respective weights are averaged. This average is assigned to each copy and information acquired from one part of an image is applied to every location in subsequent images.\nDr Hinton acknowledged that the hidden factors of neural networks may prove inscrutable to medical professionals, particularly when considering large datasets. It is difficult to tease out the individual features of a model, given that each layer is predicated on a preceding set of complex interactions. As computers become more powerful, however, their efficiency in interpreting massive datasets will only increase. The medical community should be aware of the potential applications for deep learning in healthcare. Image classification represents just one aspect of its utility.\nHinton G.

You actually seemed to enjoy yourself. What happened?\nYes, back then I really disliked being on stage and in a way I was really afraid of everybody. When you\u2019re afraid of something you get really agressive toward it. All of a sudden I got to a point where I started to have kids and stopped doing a lot of my bad habbits. You either confront that or you spend your whole life being terrified.\nThe last time we did an interview we talked about how much you missed your family while being on the road and you kept on going essentially against your will..\nI\u2019m still missing them while I\u2019m out there touring, but I came to the conclusion that with drugs and alcohol there was nothing to look forward to. I used to be like \u201clet\u2019s get the show over with, so we can smoke that bag of weed\u201d, but without those influences the best part of the day is the show itself. It took me a couple of years to analyse why I did the things I was doing and the type of music I created and I came to the conclusion that I\u2019m very fortunate that I\u2019m able to do the things I want to do and that I\u2019ve managed to establish some kind of a fanbase. After years of sort of necgleting that I came to realise it\u2019s an honour to have such a thing. There are a lot of people who would love to be in the situation we\u2019re in, so not making the most of that at this point wouldn\u2019t only be a slap in their face but also a slap in the face to the people who supported us for the past twenty years.\nI think many people appreciate your music, because it\u2019s sincere and genuine. How important is it for you to be honest in the music you create?\nIt\u2019s the only thing that is important, even though it\u2019s bad for business. The way I write is I pick up a guitar, let it all out and make it as good as it can possibly be. But I remember when I was doing Ki, Ghost or even Deconstruction it came out exactly as I wanted, but I knew for a fact it would bother people. I was concerned that some parts of my audience would see it as an insult if I wouldn\u2019t deliver the kind of music they wished me to create or that they would see it as a deliberate attempt to make them angry, because I\u2019m doing something different. That\u2019s absolutely not the case. To be completely straight up with you I write what I write and it\u2019s coming out the way it\u2019s coming out and I\u2019m trying to capture that the best I can. Sometimes it comes better out than other times, but it\u2019s always completely honest.\nYou\u2019ve expressed yourself musically in many different ways and you\u2019ve been doing this for at least twenty years. Don\u2019t you think you\u2019ve earned the right to create the music you feel like creating?\nI certainly hope so or at least I\u2019m hoping I\u2019m getting to that point soon. When I go out there playing it\u2019s so far from what I really want to do. I want it to be theatrical and to play big shows, but I want to have accoustic moments too, where it\u2019s like one person and a guitar with no production and then to have a massive production with choirs and all. At this moment we\u2019re back in a van again, making enough money to keep us on the road. As akward as those moments seem to be it\u2019s a good opportunity to experiment with some things. On the last tour I was really afraid to change the setlist. I had this sequence of songs that really did something towards the end of the show and I love that. The problem is that I have so many records under my belt and if I keep repeating myself; people who want to hear a lot of that get bored, you know? So for tonight\u2019s show I decided to change the setlist completely, so the flow was completely wrong, but it gives me the chance to see how certain songs work together. For instance the Deconstruction stuff is dark, but it\u2019s theatrical dark, but not nihilistic like the stuff I did with Strapping Young Lad. What I hope to do is to go on stage and tell some kind of story and lead it to a dark place and have the music illustrate that. When that story comes to a happy part we\u2019ll have happy music to back that up and mellow stuff for the mellower moments and so on. It\u2019s like some kind of epiphany, right?\nTalking about Deconstruction it reminds me a lot of your Strapping Young Lad material, however without all the negativy and nihilism. Your new material is still heavy, weird and outlandish, but it\u2019s executed in a very focussed and controlled way\u2026.\nThank you, it does exactly represent my current state of mind. Sometimes when people are negative towards the record for the very things it\u2019s about it becomes difficult for me to discuss it, right? The problem of this record is that it\u2019s a stream of conciousness and all the lyrics wander and that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s supposed to do. The whole four record project is suppossed to in a vague way to represent the transition of one way of thinking and creating to another and hopefully those four records represent the way that change came about.\nSo which of the four records represents your current state of being?\nGhost, 100 percent and it has been for many years. The point of Deconstruction is that the main character that the lyrics revolve around, at the end of the story has an epiphany that the thing he was focussing so heavily on adds nothing to his life and when he\u2019s standing back and reviews it all it\u2019s all so confusing and so much work that the quest he was on is in the end entirly futile. This realisation makes the character re-evaluate what\u2019s really important to him. The character is obviously me, so for me what is really important the thirty something age I am right now is \u2013 I don\u2019t drink, I don\u2019t do drugs and I\u2019m a vegitarian, so I\u2019m a boring dude, right? What I did today I walked around, rented a bike and rode around the city and I loved it. It was awesome.\nIn what way does your current sobriety influence your music and your creativity?\nThat\u2019s a good question. In the past what drugs and drinking did for me was made me focus on things that weren\u2019t imaginary but more stuff under the surface so to speak. I don\u2019t have any moral agenda, but from my experience people who normally wouldn\u2019t be interested in conspiracy theories, alien agendas or religion start focussing on those sorts of things after using mariuana or other types of drugs. I don\u2019t deny there are things under the surface, but what is really important for me is to get from point A to point B and these things under the surface has no real bearing on that. The more I focussed on those under the surface things the less I was able to cope with normal interactions. Relationships that were based on things I said I was going to do, being irresponsible in times when you need to be there, that kind of stuff. I find that with music it was very much the same. Back then I was smoking a lot of pot and doing a lot of acid I found that my music was all about those kind of philosophical and existential dramas, which exist absolutely, but I guess that\u2019s the whole idea behind Deconstruction as well, those kind of dramas rarely if ever get resolved. In many ways it\u2019s a rabbit hole of intellectual masturbation as far as I\u2019m concerned. When you dig so deep in a topic like infinity, it\u2019s infinite as far as you want to go, but by the very nature of it you won\u2019t go very far. To summerize it it all my views on music is what is it that I feel and how can I represent that sound without spending a lot of time thinking about the songs and how this and that will work and simply do it. That\u2019s probably new for me in terms of how I write music, right?\nWhat makes you tick when it comes to writing music and being creative?\nCreative freedom, productivity and I like collages. I like taking parts of my world, visiual or sonic and put them in one place and collectively they represent a certain place in time for me. With Ki I was spending a lot of time in the woods in Canada and I tried to include that kind of visiual aspect on that album.\nPersonally I very much like your Ki and Ghost albums, because they show a musical side of you which hasn\u2019t seen the light of day up until now..\nYes, but I needed to flank those albums with Addicted and Deconstruction in a way to have a certain kind of closure for a period in my life that didn\u2019t want to go away. It\u2019s like people want me to do Terria again or Strapping Young Lad again, right? Well, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m going to do. What I needed to do was to make those two records flanked by Ki and Ghost, which represents a certain period of my life, but lyrically it\u2019s about why those periods no longer a part of my emotional landscape, right? Not entirely, I did feel a connection when I wrote the music and the lyrics, but Addicted was a concious representation of that part in my carreer. With Deconstruction I wanted to address the Strapping Young Lad element, especially the Alien period, which got the best of me. I wanted to make a record that said several things. One I wanted to make something that\u2019s more complicated and deeper, production-wise than Alien, without that getting the best of me, which I did. Number two, I wanted to make something which was along that line without the self destructive and nihilistic tendency to it.\nThat\u2019s what I like about Deconstruction. It\u2019s basically Strapping Young Lad with a positive spin to it..\n100 percent! I think it was also good for me that make that kind of record to say to the people who expect me to do another S.Y.L record after all that I\u2019ve gone through, if I was to make a heavy record with this frame of mind without a lot of sacrifice, this is what it would sound like. A lot of people say: \u201cThis is not what we want\u201d and I say: \u201cAbsolutely, this is what I\u2019ve been saying for the past five years. If I was to make a heavy metal record it wouldn\u2019t be something you\u2019d expect to like or hear.\nIn all honesty I think Alien was your ultimate musical statement as far as Strapping Young Lad goes, but the The New Black, the final S.Y.L record was basically a weird collection of leftover songs thrown together in order to forefill your contract with Century Media. What are your thoughts on that?\nI agree with you there. There\u2019s one song on that record I really like and that\u2019s Almost Again, because it has a different kind of vibe. What The New Black was supposed to represent for me that after Alien I realised I\u2019ve gone too far and as result of that I compromised certain elements of my psyche that was difficult for me to reconcile. The New Black is still very much a Strapping Young Lad record, but from a musical perspective I totally agree with you. At the same time it was important for me to do that record to to conclude S.Y.L without having the notion of having one more record to do. The vibe on The New Black was this kind of jokingly take on why I have decided to change. In my mind it\u2019s still very much a S.Y.L record meant as a final middle finger and the fact that it\u2019s thrown together that worked in an artistic way, but musically it\u2019s a compromised record. I would argue though that allthough Alien is the most over-the-op record the ultimate S.Y.L statement for me is City. At the time City was exactly the same what I did with Ki and Ghost. At the time it was how I am and what I wanted to do and when I was doing Ki it was the same exact thing. When I did the selftitled S.Y.L album, Alien and The New Black I had to put myself in a state of mind that wasn\u2019t natural in order to recreate something that was natural.\nI\u2019m still kind of baffled by the change from your larger-than-life S.Y.L on stage persona and black humour to your current down to earth attitude and your postive outlook on things.\nRemember you saying that honesty was the thing you like about my records? When I started to realise that S.Y.L was more becoming an act that I was getting better and better at doing it became very difficult for me to have normal interactions with people because there was an expectation of how I would behave, but as of now when I perform it\u2019s an blown-up version of who I am, but there\u2019s no big difference between the person that\u2019s talking to you now and the guy that\u2019s playing the music on stage. Nothing that I would say on stage I wouldn\u2019t say in normal life, you know? That\u2019s the main difference. With Strapping the way I was raised sarcasm was a very important part of the family dynamic and after I got older I started to realise that if you\u2019re trained from a young age not to be angry, sarcasm and humor are good outlets to vent your anger. For me it was important to acknowledge that was very gratifying to be that vicious to the audience. Doing drugs, eating spicy food or sexual misconduct it\u2019s the same impulse of instant satisfaction. That was the image people got from me in my Strapping days and the interaction with people after the show was based on that image. Nowadays it\u2019s more like what you see is what you get, like the normal informal dude I am right now.\nAs a final question, what\u2019s next on your list now you\u2019ve finished your tour-de-force four record project?\nI\u2019m writing a bunch of very different material right know and I\u2019m experimenting with three of four different projects and I\u2019m trying to gaze which project make the people around the happiest. There\u2019s a ton of touring and I\u2019m working on a Ziltoid TV show, which I\u2019m really excited about. He\u2019s going to interview people and he has absolutely no problems with saying things I do have problems with. Besides that I\u2019ve been reading a lot and going to the beach, having picknicks and I\u2019m building furniture. I like quiet things and I\u2019m learning to allow myself to have those moments without the need of being productive.\nRay and Alternative Matter would like to extend a special thanks to Paul Collins and Kim Schepers for their kindness and hospitality.", "version": "v0"}

Favoured hosts include maize, rice and sorghum (Poaceae). Hosts also include crops within the Brassicaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Solanaceae, Rutaceae and other families. S. frugiperda is a taxonomic entity with reliable methods for identification. It is regulated in the EU as a harmful organism whose introduction into the EU is banned. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and migrates to temperate regions in North and South America during the summer. Establishment in temperate areas is prevented by its inability to overwinter. S. frugiperda has been intercepted on plant produce entering the EU. Phytosanitary measures are available to impede entry via traded commodities. In 2016, S. frugiperda was reported damaging maize in Africa. Subsequent reports indicate that it continues to spread severely damaging maize and other crops. If S. frugiperda spreads into north Africa, the likelihood of adults migrating into the temperate EU increases. Within the scope and level of analysis appropriate for pest categorisation, the EFSA Plant Health Panel concludes that S. frugiperda could establish in a small area of the southern EU from where it is likely to enter more northern regions forming transient summer populations, particularly in maize growing regions where impacts on yield could occur. However, uncertainties regarding establishment remain. Considering the criteria within the remit of EFSA to assess as regards status as a potential Union quarantine pest (QP) or as a potential regulated non\u2010quarantine pest (RNQP), S. frugiperda satisfies the criteria to be regarded a Union QP but does not meet the criteria of (i) occurring in the EU territory, and (ii) plants for planting being the principal means of spread, criteria required for RNQP status.", "version": "v0"}

The blade began as a little seed in my mind after reading the book \u201cSwords of the Viking Age\u201d by Ian Pierce. As I turned pages 148 and 149, very much at the end of the book and having already seen many photographs of wonderful pattern-welding, I was stunned by two photographs depicting a sword found in Vehmaa and dating to the 8th century. My first impression looking at the photographs on both pages is that I was looking at two different swords but reading the brief notes I was further shocked in realizing that it was only one. Ever since I saw that blade I wanted to try and figure out how the pattern was created.\nThat was many moons ago. Then going back some three or four years I saw Jeff's repair on the handle of a Viking sword and that sword and another were shown at Fire&Brimstone. When I held the one blade with the Petersen L morphology, I felt a more compelling need to try to make the Vehmaa sword.\nIt took me the best part of a year of on and off reviewing my original notes on the pattern and developing new ideas to sort out how could it be re-made. Aided at times by a 3D CAD program to determine the composition, layer count and arrangement of the rods, I was able to figure out the individual patterns but not quite able to determine how where they put together and the transitions from one pattern to another realized. One day when I least expected it, I came up with a plausible solution and even if it is not how the original was made, I was happy enough with the plans to make some billets and get ready to test my thoughts in the fire.\nI used 1095 and 15N20. About 6 kg of steel to begin with and run the tests I wanted with enough material to spare. I made core rods and edge rods. The edge rods were 1095 and W2.\nThe five rods that were to become the core of the blade needed to be twisted and/or manipulated to very precise dimensions. The day I did the twists I had two pages of carefully detailed directions as to where to start and stop each twist and how many turns to do. It was nerve wrecking as any one single mistake would have thrown the pattern off. Everything needed to line up as close to the layout directions as possible.\nThe next issue was to figure out how much material to remove from either side to expose the pattern exactly where it was intended and for most people who have done this, they would realize that the pattern is shown at different depths on different sections on both sides of the blade.\nThe most dificult weld was the last. Attaching the wrap-around edge to the core had to be done when the billets were \u00bc\u201d thick and there was no wiggle room for any offset as it would simply ruin the carefully develop pattern.\nUnfortunately, the first sword did not show the correct patterns after grinding as a result of miscalculating the depth. The blade was very interesting in itself but not was I was going after. So a second blade was started and with the gained knowledge from the previous one, the patterns were pre-arranged where after grinding they will show at the correct depth.\nSo now it was on to profiling on the grinder and heat treating. The blade look really pretty dressed in its tempering colors.\nBut it had a little bit of a warping towards the point which I tried and tried to straighten at tempering temperature for a couple days. Finally I thought I had straighten it just to come in the shop the next morning and see that that curve had come back to some degree after cooling. I thought that it was such a little curve that I put it in the vise cold and tried to fix it. The blade broke in two.\nToo bad as the pattern was for the most part there. The serpent section was not as tight as I wanted but everything else was right on. The next week instead of feeling pity on myself I went back to the shop to make a new set of billets for a third attempt. Although for a day or two I did walk with my head down.\nThird time\u2019s a charm. I had the sword I wanted with the correct amount of tightness for the serpent and although one of the chevron sections did not have the correct spacing, it was close enough. I was not planning on hilting the blade or making a scabbard but I needed some sort of sheath to keep the blade in so I made a wooden one and it looked so nice that I was compelled to finish it with a leather wrap and lambskin liner. At that point there was no turning back from making a hilt for it too.\nThe blade itself is 950 grams and the length without the tang was 32 \u00bd\u201d. Width of 1 7/8\u201d at the base and tapering from there. Polishing the w2/1095 edge to show contrast was a bit tricky and ended up using a method similar to the Japanese polish for the edge.\nI had a smile on my face when it was finished.\nHere you can see how subtle the edge pattern is.\nFor those interested in trying to figure out the pattern-welding, there are a couple more images at my website made in Photoshop by combining many sectional pictures. The proportions of the handle and blade were a bit deformed by the program but the pattern is more easily discerned.\nScroll to the very end of the pages for those two images.\nMy respect for the smith who made the original sword is enormous. I don't think that I actually followed the process that he used to make his sword in making mine. He knew what he wanted to do and how to do it. Thanks to all my friends that help me in one way or another through questions and answers on the making on the different parts of this blade. You know who you are.\nOh my God! That is magnificent! I can't recall seeing a pattern on a pattern welded sword that I like more. The hilt and scabbard are outstanding too! Thank you for sharing this!\nThat is a legendary Finnish blade and since I read about it last year I had been dreaming of one day being able to commission it. You did extremely well. The patterns on this make it a masterpiece of design and execution. Thank you for sharing it. Whoever ends up with it will be so happy. I wish I could throw my hat in the ring. Well done. Just amazing.\nThat is amazing! Well done Sir! Truly an incredible piece.\nAn immensely beautiful creation, and the walk-through was very informative.\nIt's incredible how many talented swordsmiths post to this forum.\nIn viewing your website I see no other European based pieces, is this your first?\nThank you, guys. For the time being this sword is going to stay home.\nI have made some falcata and several seax but mostly I do Japanese-style work.\nAh yes, I see that now, apologies.\nAn intelligent & artistic dedication on everything I have seen. Kudos to you.\nReally outstanding work. The winding pattern near the blade tip is truly incredible. Absolutely stunning. I also really love the texture on the scabbard.\nI am amazed and in awe of what the top sword smiths can accomplish. It does not seem like some thing that well executed would ever be possible.\nI was at one time caretaker for a large pattern welded langsax with a red bone handle that you made. I thought it was great, but this is just beyond her in so many ways.\nThis is significant work , a real leap within a craft that is constantly surpassing it's self.\nExceptional and inspiring and so beautifully executed.\nWell done Jesus , I hope this pushed you even further .\nSo this is the real Vehmaa sword. This sword, however, dates from the 8th century and was discovered in Vehmaa, Finland. The date of its discovery remains unknown.\nThis sword may well have the most beautiful pattern of any I've ever seen!", "version": "v0"}

In July 2015, however, the Turkish Armed Forces launched airstrikes against PKK targets following an attack that killed two policemen. Turkey\u2019s renewed focus on the PKK might result in a recruitment problem for the Kurdish armed group\u2014PKK must now fight a two-front war with Turkey on one side and jihadists in Iraq and Syria on the other. This could hurt the US-led campaign against ISIS after Kurdish forces in Syria have proven to be the most effective force on the ground.\nTwo weeks before Turkey launched airstrikes in July against the PKK, ISIS published a prediction of this conflict in its online Dabiq magazine. ISIS hoped this development would give their forces an advantage in northern Syria. The PKK-Turkish ceasefire disintegrated after the PKK killed two Turkish policemen in revenge for the Suruc bomb attack that killed thirty-two, Turkey started bombing PKK camps in northern Iraq. With the outbreak of hostilities, ISIS seeks to capitalize on the thinly stretched PKK. The near daily attacks on PKK positions by the Turkish military could pose a significant problem for the YPG operating in Syria, which has increasingly relied on Kurds from Turkey to fill their ranks in the fight against ISIS.\nThe YPG faces the risk of geographical overstretch after capturing between 4,100 and 11,000 square kilometers from ISIS, including the Tal Abyad border crossing. The YPG could only advance due to support from coalition airstrikes launched to support the YPG since September 23, 2014. According to the Pentagon, nearly 70 percent of the airstrikes in Syria between September 2014 and January 2015 supported the YPG in the recapture of Kobani. ISIS realizes that without airstrikes, the YPG already lacks the manpower to hold captured territory.\nThe YPG already faces recruitment issues due to mass migration of Syrian Kurds to neighboring countries and Europe, thanks to the ongoing conflict in the region and poor economic conditions. \u201cIf everybody leaves, who then will fight ISIS jihadists who come from Europe?\u201d YPG fighters asked Dutch journalist Harold Doornbos in Efrin. To stem the outflow of migrants, Efrin\u2019s local administration has imposed a ban on emigrating without a valid reason.\nThere are already examples of how the lack of manpower made it more difficult for the YPG to provide protection for civilians in YPG-controlled areas. While the YPG diverted more resources to the frontlines, ISIS managed to infiltrate Kobani on June 26, and killed at least 233 civilians. Since ISIS launched a siege on Kobani in March 2014, the YPG has increasingly recruited Kurds from Turkey to bolster their ranks. Before March 2014, the YPG tried to recruit mostly Syrian Kurds to avoid the image of being too closely linked to the PKK, still listed as a terrorist organization by the United States, EU, and Turkey.\nThe YPG official website shows that many of the recently killed YPG fighters are Kurds from Turkey. On July 13, for example, the YPG announced the identities of sixteen fallen YPG fighters, only two of whom were Kurds from Syria. To make up for the lack of fighters, the YPG has instituted a mandatory military draft to recruit young Kurdish men between the age of eighteen and thirty in the provinces of Hasaka, since July 2014, and in Efrin, since May 2015.\nBut with increasing urban warfare between the Turkish state and Kurds in Turkey, and airstrikes against PKK targets in northern Iraq, it will be more difficult for the YPG to recruit Turkish Kurds to fight against ISIS in Syria. Since August 2014, the PKK has deployed fighters to several frontlines in Iraqi Kurdistan, including Sinjar and Kirkuk. It remains unclear if the PKK will maintain its forces there, or if the war between the PKK and the Turkish state leads to their withdrawal.\nAccording to the Turkish government, 814 PKK rebels were killed since July while the PKK said they killed 471 Turkish security forces. Although these statistics are most likely exaggerated, it does show that the PKK is losing fighters in Turkey. These losses will likely lead to Kurds in Turkey wanting to fight in Turkey itself, rather than for the YPG or PKK in Iraq and Syria.\nWith the Turkey-PKK clashes unlikely stop in the near term, the YPG will have to step up its military recruitment of Syrian Kurds and cooperate with Arab tribes to incorporate Arabs into the YPG. The recent PKK attack in the Daglica area of Hakkari province near the Iraqi border that killed at least thirty-one Turkish soldiers and the continued violence in Cizre show that there is no end in sight of the Turkey-PKK conflict. For the near future, the YPG will struggle to raise its capacity to fight ISIS, no doubt hurting the anti-ISIS coalition\u2019s efforts.\nWladimir van Wilgenburg is an analyst of Kurdish politics for the Jamestown Foundation.\nWashington-Ankara: Same Page for Syria and ISIL?", "version": "v0"}

It\u2019s also a situation that some people find themselves in more than others, due to differences in immune systems and the stability of one\u2019s mental health. There\u2019s no shame in declaring yourself unfit to work.\nIndeed, there\u2019s pride to be found in the strength of this decision. But you\u2019ll need to ensure you\u2019re dealing with this situation in the right way, as the following guide outlines.\nYour first option, should you feel like you can\u2019t go to your workplace but you\u2019re equally keen not to abandon work altogether, is to compromise. Suggest to your manager that you work from home on a strictly temporary basis while you recover from your illness. This can often be an amenable middle-ground that ensures your workplace doesn\u2019t lose a valued member of staff, but that you\u2019re able to take naps, medicine and other breaks when you want to ensure your full recovery. It goes without saying that this option is only available to those who are able to work remotely.\nThe more severe your illness, the more uncompromising you need to be. By stating to your manager that there is no way you\u2019ll be able to make it in for a week, you\u2019ll be doing them a favor by declaratively telling them what human resources they can expect to turn up to work each day. If possible, get a doctor\u2019s note to back up your statement, which will void any arguments from your workplace that you\u2019re taking unnecessary time off. The more forceful you are, the more you\u2019ll be able to relax in the knowledge that your workplace is aware of the severity of your situation.\nPeople who are frequently so ill as to have to miss work might feel that when they return they\u2019re discriminated against in some way. In the long-run, this can even lead to unfair dismissal because your workplace wrongly believes you\u2019ve been taking liberties with your time off. You should immediately contact spencerssolicitors.com, employment law specialists, in the event of you feeling discriminated against in the workplace. They\u2019ll help explain your rights to you and may even issue a legal challenge against your employer on your behalf.\nThis tip is especially important for those whose reason for missing work is a mental rather than a physical health issue. For many who ask for time off work, this is precisely the case. Schedule a meeting with a manager that you trust and who knows you well, and be honest about your predicament.

Cohen Award for Antitrust Scholarship.\nThe United States is much less a nation of entrepreneurs than it was a generation ago. Small, independent businesses have declined sharply in both numbers and market share across many sectors of the economy. Between 1997 and 2012, the number of small manufacturers fell by more 70,000, local retailers saw their ranks diminish by about 108,000, and the number of community banks and credit unions dropped by half, from about 26,000 to 13,000. At the same time, starting a new business appears to have become harder than ever. The number of startups launched annually has fallen by nearly half since the 1970s.\nAs stunning as these figures are, there has been remarkably little public debate about this profound structural shift taking place in the U.S. economy. We tend to accept the decline of small business as the inevitable result of market forces. Big companies are thought to be more efficient and productive; therefore, although we may miss the corner drugstore or the family-owned auto repair shop, their demise is unavoidable, and it\u2019s economically beneficial.\nBut our new report suggests a different, and very troubling, explanation for the dwindling ranks of small businesses. It presents evidence that their decline is owed, at least in part, to anticompetitive behavior by large, dominant corporations. Drawing on examples in pharmacy, banking, telecommunications, and retail, it finds that big companies routinely use their size and their economic and political power to undermine their smaller rivals and exclude them from markets.\nThese abuses have gone unchecked because of a radical change in the ideological framework that guides anti-monopoly policy. About thirty-five years ago, policy-makers came to view maximizing efficiency \u2014 rather than maintaining fair and open markets for all competitors \u2014 as the primary aim of antitrust enforcement. This was a profound departure from previous policy and America\u2019s long-standing anti-monopoly tradition. Over time, this ideological shift impacted more than antitrust enforcement. It infused much of public policy with a bias in favor of big business, creating an environment less and less hospitable to entrepreneurs.\nSmall businesses deliver distinct consumer and market benefits, and in some sectors provide more value and better outcomes than their bigger competitors. And they often achieve these superior results because of their small scale, not in spite of it.\nAn economy populated by many small, independent businesses produces a more equitable distribution of income and opportunity, creates more jobs, and supports an expansive middle class.\nSmall-scale enterprise is compatible with democracy, while concentrated economic power threatens our liberty and our ability to be a self-governing people.\nTo restore competition and America\u2019s entrepreneurial tradition, we can draw on our own rich antimonopoly history. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, reformers enacted policies to break up concentrated power and ensure a level playing field for small businesses. These laws are still on the books, and the principles they embody are still relevant. With a fresh look at how we enforce them, these policies can go a long way toward reviving competition and small business. This report concludes by outlining several specific steps for doing so.\nThis paper is one of seven papers in the Report on Antitrust and Entrepreneurship, which is part of an American Antitrust Institute (AAI) project, made possible by a grant from the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. The Report\u2019s papers examine the important relationship between entrepreneurial activity and competition policy and enforcement.

This perception did not change even when Olamide who came in after the demise of another rap and street star, DaGrin started his career in that line, rapping with indigenous Yoruba language and pidgin.\nThe perception we have of Olamide as street despite his fantastic rap was well promoted by the artiste because guess what? He is street, well loved by the street but was not seen like his contemporaries Wizkid and Davido in the music industry because, for some unspoken reason, people don\u2019t compare them equally with Olamide leaving them to roll and rule his genre. This lack of equal comparison I believe is more of the artiste\u2019s act to not be compared than fans and music critics who don\u2019t pass up an opportunity to compare artistes. It is more of Olamide because while his contemporaries were focused on the love song in hip-hop and sometimes mild social/political issue, Olamide has consciously made it known that he sings for a group that is hardly ever represented which is the street and guess what? He has done that so well.\nThis article is hereby written to show you how Olamide is effortlessly changing the street narrative, showing the world that being part of the street is not a defect, and also making the idea of being street really appealing that everyone wants to be a part of it. How?\n1. His Songs: The first thing to talk about is Olamide\u2019s songs and how he is using it to tell the Street story. At the beginning of this year, Olamide released Science student and that song was for some reasons a controversial one with people saying Olamide should never do such a song that promotes nothing but the drug culture in the street. I was pained by these people\u2019s lack of patience in listening to good lyrics and jumping the gun to criticise it, all because it was done by an artiste majorly known as \u201cstreet\u201d. Another reason I didn\u2019t blame some of these unprofessional critics was because they are already used to listening to street artistes promoting such activities in streets but what I didn\u2019t find good enough was that the song had to be banned from airplay and for me that was a wrong call because they made Olamide pay for the ignorance of people who didn\u2019t listen well because if they had listened well, not to judge but to understand, they would\u2019ve known the difference between awareness and promotion.\nOlamide uses his songs to tell the stories in the street with a language that can only be used to tell it\u2026 his indigenous language and pidgin which equates street language. Is there any other way he could\u2019ve told the story? Yes, but that won\u2019t be the original way and Baddo likes to stick with his originality. His originality and consistency has made his songs acceptable and loved massively that everyone now wants to do street and be street\u2026 even the posh ajebutter Koko master, D\u2019banj is doing street.\nSo guess what? With Olamide\u2019s songs, he has made what is supposed to be razz acceptable in our ever judgemental society and that is one way he has changed the street narrative, that it can definitely be an acceptable sound and be a part of the society.\n2. A defying-Stereotype Personality: When I heard that Olamide\u2019s WO was banned I expected a social media outburst or a bass*ss defensive tweet that we know some of our artistes for. I waited for one and it didn\u2019t come, rather what came was an apology stating that the song never meant to be perceived the way it was. Similar expectation I had when the same treatment was given to Science Student (my bad) but same similar response of apology came from Baddo explaining that he was simply creating awareness for drug abuse and seriously kicking against it going further to releasing a dope video to prove that point, writing it legibly on the screen \u201cSay No To Drug Abuse\u201d for those that would still misconstrue the video and its relation to the song.\nLet\u2019s be sincere, with the stereotype we have created concerning the street and what it represents, it is nothing but aggressive attitude a lot of people expect from Olamide with all he was facing, but Olamide handled it well, showing us that although he is from the street, he will not promote the negative ideologies people believe about the street with his reaction.\nBut come to think of it., do you know Olamide is one artiste, despite how \u201cstreet\u201d he is and how offensive we see his song doesn\u2019t promote drugs and excessive alcoholism on his social media pages such as Instagram like we see other artistes do? Going through Olamide\u2019s IG page, you\u2019ll hardly see him promoting any of that and I felt someone should\u2019ve for once connected that dot while he was being bashed for science students, but hey, at the end, we train our minds to see things we want them to see no matter how true they are. Olamide through his personality and attitude has promoted a personality contrary to what is expected of a stereotypical street kid and for that, we give him thumbs up.\n3. Compelling Growth But Still Street: So the whole essence of this post is the announcement Olamide made today that he is now the proud owner of a TV station where he promises great entertainment content. This came as a huge surprise to a lot of people who didn\u2019t see it coming with his eight years in the Nigerian music industry. Considering the perception people have about Olamide, nobody expected this kind of growth, not that he can\u2019t do something bigger, but no one knew Olamide has a media dream to own a TV station. This is a great development because this same street king has created a platform where he can unapologetically be street, not just promote street, but also create through pictures and visuals the kind of street he wants to see. But most importantly, Olamide can now without fear while playing by the rules create awareness for the street and not care about if it\u2019ll be turned down by the media because he already has a medium.\nAll these, his songs, personality shown so far, and his growth is one that we can say is truly chnging the narrative of the street artiste who doesn\u2019t have to end up negatively but is as great as he wants to be, through his hard work of course.\nThis said, Olamide recent good news is a big win for the street and every child and dreamer from the street because it doesn\u2019t just show them that their dreams are valid, it shows them that these valid dreams can also come true if, like Olamide, they focus on their growth and not look at the controversy society tries to create with and against them. Olamide is the proof they need that they don\u2019t need to do drugs as artistes and live according to what people think about them. He is a proof that they don\u2019t need to be all razz because they\u2019re street and promote the negative narrative that is already pining most down. Olamide is a proof that everyone won\u2019t like you, but if you like you, they\u2019ll soon like you and start doing what you do.

This is done by: providing on-campus programming, direct support, and connecting students to various on-campus resources, information and services needed to be successful in college. The ScholarCorps AmeriCorps member is charged with providing Scholars with resources in alignment with the four programmatic focus areas.\nGraduate with an Indiana High School Diploma from a state-accredited high school.\nParticipate in a Scholar Success Program that helps students plan, prepare and pay for college success.\nAchieve a cumulative high school GPA of at least 2.5 on a 4.0 scale.\nNot use illegal drugs or alcohol, or commit a crime or delinquent act.\nApply for admission to an eligible Indiana college or university as a high school senior.\nApply on time for student financial aid (by April 15th of the student's senior year of high school).\nIndiana's 21st Century Scholars Program began in 1990 to ensure that every Hoosier student can afford the opportunity provided by a college degree. Today, eligible students who keep the Scholar Pledge to excellence in school and life receive a Scholarship to help pay for their college education.\nScholarCorps AmeriCorps members are placed at select colleges and universities across Indiana and serve as an on-campus resource to freshman and sophomore 21st Century Scholar students enrolled at that institution. This is the second year a ScholarCorps member has been at IU Southeast.\nAfter graduating from IU Southeast as a 21st Century Scholar, I wanted to give back to the program. Fortunately, I was able to being serving on campus with ScholarCorps. As a Scholar myself, I understood the unique challenges that the group faces. My year of service was incredibly rewarding; I was able to help students and make a difference. My goal over my term was to emphasize that the importance of being a 21st Century Scholar is not just limited to finances. There are opportunities for engagement and involvement around every corner. There is truly a community on campus that will support students and nurture them to succeed. Providing support and programing to the Scholars on campus contributed immensely to my personal growth. I cannot imagine where I would be if I did not seize the opportunity to join ScholarCorps. Staying involved on campus at IU Southeast in this role motivated me to pursue my dreams. I am proud to say that after my service I began attending graduate school at the IU School of Public and Environmental Affairs.\nMy time serving at Indiana University Southeast in ScholarCorps allowed me to spend the year between graduating college and starting a master's program near my family and giving back to a program that has benefited me immensely. As a 21st Century Scholar Alumna who graduated from Indiana University Bloomington, I honestly do not believe that I would be the person I am today if not for the 21st Century Scholar program and my time spent as an AmeriCorps member. My year of service taught me a lot about developing and managing a program, granted me the opportunity to interact with college and high school students as a professional, and allowed me to develop a greater sense of confidence as I interacted with the faculty and staff at IU Southeast and representatives of the 21st Century Scholar program at the state and regional level. All of this continues to benefit me as I pursue a career in psychological research. After my time as a ScholarCorps member, I began a Master's in General Psychology program at the University of Dayton. I intend to continue my education in order to obtain a Ph.D. in Psychology.", "version": "v0"}

Evidence was found in a video posted on YouTube in October 2009.\nSAN FRANCISCO, March 23, 2010 --In a very candid letter in the today's Catholic San Francisco, Public Policy and Social Concerns Director, Goerge Wesolek joined what is starting to be a chorus of Church officials acknowledging the split between Catholic Hospitals and ideologically oriented nuns that own them and the U.S. bishops over the expansion of abortion in the recently passed healthcare reform bill. The sisters actually claimed the bishops were lying about the abortion provisions that reversed longstand U.S. policy and have cleared the way for taxpayer funding of abortion.\nWASHINGTON, DC, March 21, 2010 -- Apparently pro-life Democrats are starting to buckle under pressure. In exchange, the President has committed to issue an executive order barring taxpayer funding of abortion. This is nothing but a public acknowledgment by the President that the flawed Senate-passed bill does indeed clear the way for taxpayer funded abortions. If they were sincere, they would allow the ban on taxpayer funding to be put into the law. The executive order is meaningless as it can be rescinded at any time. Obama has previously rescinded the Mexico City policy executive order that prevented taxpayer money to be spent abortions and coerced sterilizations.\nWASHINGTON, DC, March 18, 2010 -- White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs revealed to reporters today that President Barack Obama actively promoted the Catholic Health Association's public break with the American Catholic bishops to support his health care legislation.\nWASHINGTON, DC, March 18, 2010 -- Catholic Health Association President, Sr. Carol Keehan, DC, representing Catholic hospitals, has incited vocal opposition from bishops across the country in response to her letter to Congress requesting passage of the Senate-passed healthcare reform bill that includes taxpayer funding for abortion. The Catholic hospitals' outspoken support for this morally flawed bill is causing confusion among Catholics and may lead some to unwittingly ask their congressman to pass it when they would actually oppose it if they had the facts from the bishops and pro-life organizations. More importantly, the confusion is making it more difficult for pro-life Democrats to resist the pressure they are getting from the President and the Democratic leadership in the House.\nWASHINGTON, DC, March 16, 2010 -- This Catholic Healthcare Association (CHA) broke ranks with the US Bishops throwing their support behind the Senate-passed health care bill that clears the way for taxpayer funding of abortion. This hurts chances for defeating the bill and could provide cover for congressmen on the fence to give into pressure they are receiving from the President and Democratic leadership in the House.", "version": "v0"}

The one with Keira Knightley as Anna Karenina.\nI sent this quote to my husband. I told him that he was free to share this with his cow.\n\u201cOtherwise, we might as well be cattle.\u201d Great line.\nThanks Elizabeth for your comments. It has been a process and part of my journey. I have felt the need to share honestly and openly about my feelings and actions. I don\u2019t think the other woman should be allowed to go unscathed with all the devastation she has caused to me and my children and the rest our family and friends. The ripple effect is quite large and I feel like me acting as though it is anything other than the destruction that is and turning a blind eye to the cause of the devastation would be doing other people in this world and God an injustice. Janice Andrews acted unconscientiously when she chose to pursue a married man with a family. She declared war on me with her actions. Certainly my ex is 100% to blame as well. I think my ex has contributed greatly on top of the affair by not treating me and our children with fairness, kindness or any remorse with the end of our marriage. It could all be finalized by now but my ex simply refuses to allow us all to move on. I would have no reason to focus on him or the other woman if he just followed our mediation agreement that took us 2 years to work out. I have lost so much financially and he knows he has bettered me financially in the settlement yet he wants to fight and fight and push me as far into the ground as he can. I realize now that he is simply not capable of experiencing any compassion or sympathy for people he has hurt by his actions and therefore is rejecting any legal responsibilities he has as a result of his actions. He finds the need instead to try and punish me when he is the one who has put us on these new paths we both find ourselves. He continues to waste my time and energy and resources that could be better spent on our children\u2019s education. My daughter also just brought to my attention that the other woman is using social media to make fun of partners who have issues with their significant other cheating. Both Janice Andrews and my ex think cheating is a joke and are laughing at those affected. I will never forgive them. I suspect, based on their comments on social media, they feel no need to forgive themselves and will continue to go out and do harm to the world. I am just telling it like it is. I am working on making sure that they do as little additional harm to me and my children. I don\u2019t believe this situation makes me stronger but I do know it reveals to those in my life and to me that I do have strength of character. A friend just said to me on Saturday, \u201cHow can you be so positive and optimistic?\u201d I am just sharing my story as part of my healing process and if it makes anyone think along the way on how they could handle things better then maybe my sharing can help others. If it makes one person say, \u201cI\u2019m not going to pursue that person I am attracted to because they are married, have a family and it would be wrong and selfish and there will be consequences I couldn\u2019t possibly imagine\u201d then maybe my blog can have some other purpose as well. Thank you for taking the time to share your comments and I appreciate your thoughts, advice, \u201cpreaching\u201d and kind words.", "version": "v0"}

At local schools 6 pupils out of 10 are foreign-born. 70% of resident migrants live in the Villaggio Gorizia, a small area with a high population density. Baranzate is therefore a place particularly suitable for the testing of new models of coexistence and integration between cultures outlined by the UN Agenda 2030, with particular reference to the objectives 10 \"Reducing inequalities within and between countries\" and 11 \"Sustainable cities and communities\".\nThe broad and integrated action of \"Beyond the margins\" is based on the promotion of two fundamental rights, health and work. The project aims to improve the living conditions of migrants living in Baranzate through the promotion of an inclusive working model - supporting women in daily work, introducing the \"migrant mentoring\" tool, creating extra-curricular support services and stimulating the creation of meeting places for women - and working at the same time to respond to new health care needs of the Municipality of Baranzate, providing paediatric care services, awareness and information.\nThe support activities for the promotion of a working model as part of the project \"Beyond the Margins\" focus on \"Fiori all'Occhiello\", a multi-ethnic tailoring and project of social entrepreneurship, launched in October 2014 by the Association La Rotonda which brings together tailors from different ethnic backgrounds in a close-knit workgroup. Within the project, many services have been implemented with the overall aim to promote the business development of Fiori all'Occhiello, through actions supporting the quality of life of female workers and more generally citizens of Baranzate, in order to contribute concretely to feeding the social fabric of the community.\nThe scientific instrument chosen as a catalyst to facilitate the process is \"migrant mentoring\", which foresees the introduction and support of a mentor within the foreign community. This figure shares, relating to the target group, a similar experience of migration, at the same time, however, they have already achieved important goals in their path of integration in the host country, and are therefore a model of success - inspiring and not discouraging - to which they can aim for.\nThe positive effects achieved from the introduction of the figure of a migrant mentor in foreign communities, with the aim of promoting their integration, are also proven by scientific studies, the main ones are discernible in the development of so-called \"soft skills\", in the improvement of social skills and self-esteem, in defining their long-term objectives and the ability to create a network of relationships. All this helps to become an \"active cog\" in society.\nThe services initiated in this area are: the introduction of a mentor of Moroccan nationality in the multi-ethnic tailor's Fiori all'Occhiello, which has become a reference point for Arab women; the opening of the Caff\u00e8 delle Donne (Women's Cafe) on 8th October 2016, an informal meeting space aimed at women living in Baranzate, Italian and foreign, with the aim of promoting women's empowerment through services related to looking for work and learning the Italian language; the set-up of the after-school babysitting service for the seamstresses' children; the creation of a series of meetings with the seamstresses' husbands mostly Muslim faith, run by Don Paolo, the parish priest of Baranzate and intended to promote discussion and awareness on issues such as women's empowerment, the difficulties of the integration process, the education of children; the activation of workshops inspired by the Bruno Munari method during the summer months, aimed at children of all ethnic groups, to foster communication through creativity.\nFor this purpose, different activities to provide previously lacking health services were developed, and at the same time to promote a culture of healthcare especially in the migrant population who, because of the difficulty of access to information or due to cultural and religious differences, has little awareness of the health risks that surround them.\nSince March 2016, a paediatrician from the CDI - Italian Diagnostic Centre, part of the Bracco Group, has been based at the healthcare help desk activated by the association La Rotonda at \"La Porta della Salute\" of Baranzate. The paediatric service is free and available once a week. In order to promote linguistic understanding and reduce cultural barriers between migrant mothers and the paediatrician, as part of the migrant mentoring initiative; a mediator, of Moroccan origin, is on hand to support the provision of basic health information. From March to July 2016 there were 111 visits to the paediatric help desk, most of which were made by foreign-born women.\nThe project provides the opportunity to carry out Pap tests and HPV tests free of charge, with the aim of providing women, particularly foreign and of Muslim faith, access to preventive controls with regard to the early detection of cervical cancer and prevention of the Papilloma Virus.\nAwareness of the importance of good dietary choices for the health of pregnant women and their children and the risks associated with following a Western diet for immigrant women is one of the aspects of health promotion that the project aims to achieve. As a result, a series of meetings were set up to teach foreign mothers how to combine Italian foods to achieve balanced dishes that help with their children's growth; this initiative was deemed necessary following the detection of cases of malnutrition by the paediatrician.\nWith the aim of expanding the awareness on the importance of prevention, two rounds of meetings have been established: the first, for the parents of the community belonging to the Parish of Sant'Arialdo, with the aim of raising awareness of the importance of administering the vaccine against the Papilloma Virus, the second for adolescents selected by the association La Rotonda on the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases.", "version": "v0"}

Everyone from Wall Street brokers to retail investors wonders whether they should put their money in oil.\nI always tell my subscribers to avoid making decisions before they have all the facts. The more you know about oil investing, the better. Focus on educating yourself on the market, including investor and consumer sentiment, so you don\u2019t kick yourself when you miss a potentially profitable play.\nTo start you on your journey, I\u2019ve come up with four facts you don\u2019t know about oil investing, but should. Expect to call your broker as soon as you\u2019re done reading \u2014 or, at the very least, start watching oil stocks more regularly.\nAccording to the EIA, American households devote approximately $2,000 to gassing up their cars each year. This is down from its peak of about $2,700, but it\u2019s still significant.\nPeople need to get places. Even if Americans and other people around the world aren\u2019t driving, they\u2019re taking public transportation or calling Ubers. This is especially true in suburban and urban areas and cities that aren\u2019t particularly walkable.\nAs much as we might hate to admit it, we need gasoline to get around. Hybrid and electric cars exist, but they\u2019re many years away from becoming universally accessible, even to middle-class Americans.\nEvolution takes time. Many people don\u2019t trust electric cars or bemoan the fact that they have to think about charging their cars rather than just stopping at the pump. This time is what gives oil investing its shine \u2014 people still need gas.\nOf course, oil is used for the manufacturing of many other things, from plastic to pavement. The petroleum industry has taken a few hits over the years, but there are still many investable companies to help beef up your portfolio.\nWhen you look at a stock chart, you want to see significant volatility. This concept refers to the price action of a particular stock. If it\u2019s flatlined, there\u2019s no reason to invest. But if it\u2019s moving up and down, you have the potential to cash in.\nOil investing is a great investment because its stocks are notoriously volatile. As market sentiment changes and as news emerges on CNN, investors either buy in or sell. Savvy investors know how to take advantage of both the upside and the downside, so volatility doesn\u2019t have to mean huge losses if you\u2019re unsure of the price action.\nPaying attention to days, weeks, or months of support and resistance can make you more confident in oil investing. If you see a steadily rising resistance relative to support, you can buy shares in that stock and ride the wave until you see signs that it might start to drop.\nJust remember that volatility is nothing without volume. Some of the smaller oil companies might experience lots of volatility in the small dollar ranges, but have low volume. This means that there aren\u2019t many investors trading shares.\nAvoid those companies during your oil price investing efforts. Look for lots of shares moving back and forth between buyers and sellers, especially over a long period of time. If the price action happens to move against you, you\u2019ll want to be able to exit your position quickly and avoid taking a big hit to your brokerage account balance.\nCertain companies flail during economic downturns. Luxury brands, for instance, often lose a significant portion of their revenue. The same goes for vehicle manufacturers, real estate agents and brokers, and hospitality.\nHowever, there are two types of businesses that flourish during recessions: those that provide necessities and those that provide comfort.\nPeople still need to put gas in their cars during a recession. They need toilet paper, cleaning supplies, and food. Additionally, people comfort themselves on bar stools, with cable television, and on low-cost entertainment, such as movie theaters.\nIf you learn oil investing now, you\u2019ll be able to keep investing profitably even if the economy begins to flounder. We\u2019ve had several good years ever since the bailouts that occurred during 2008 and 2009. But a downturn will eventually occur again, and you\u2019ll want to be ready with good oil price investing skills.\nWhen people think of oil investing, they picture Exxon, Shell, and Halliburton. These aren\u2019t the only investable companies. In fact, while I recommend long-term investments in large, stable companies, you can often profit more from oil investing when you target the younger, smaller outfits.\nThese companies might not have as much cash flow, but they\u2019re hungry. They\u2019re also more volatile because of their instability.\nOil investing for short-term profits can help boost your income investing cash flow and introduce new ways to build your wealth. When I send out my profit alerts to subscribers, I\u2019m often focused on these smaller companies because I can predict their price movements with surprising accuracy.\nYou might look for companies that make the heavy machinery that larger companies use for drilling, fracking, and other processes. There are many avenues to take, and oil is one of the largest sectors in the stock market.\nAre you interested in oil investing? Have you tried it? You might want to think about shifting at least part of your investments to the oil industry.\nThis includes the smaller companies that have lots of volatility and volume. They cost less per share, so you can buy (or short) larger positions. And since oil is a necessity on which we depend \u2014 at least for now \u2014 you can count on oil price investing no matter what the economy does.\nConsider the makeup of your investment portfolio and make sure it has some oil stocks in it. If it doesn\u2019t, start oil investing now.\nThis entry was posted in Dr. Kent Moors, oil, oil price investing and tagged Oil investing, Oil price investing.

But if caught in the US, they will be given a one way ticket back to the dangerous situation they fled.\nRains associated with Tropical Storm Alex, have left three dead in El Salvador and more than 1200 people flooded out of their homes according to LPG. An orange alert continues in the country with schools closed in affected areas. As I mentioned in my last post, these storms can significantly impact the country's agricultural production, in addition to the loss of human life and the destruction of people's homes.\nIn September and October of that year, the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climate phenomenon led to a shortage in rainfall throughout Central America, which negatively affected the planting of grain and bean crops in areas of Nicaragua, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, according to the FAO report.\nThen, in November, Hurricane Ida struck Central America, causing severe damage to agricultural infrastructure in parts of the region. In El Salvador, heavy rains left 198 people dead and 15,000 homeless, in addition to 239 million dollars in losses and damages.\nOscar Luna was re-elected by El Salvador's National Assembly as the country's Human Rights Ombudsman (PDDH for its Spanish initials).\nOne of the highest profile members of government in El Salvador has no power and no ability to make or enforce laws. The post of PDDH was created in the constitution following the 1992 peace accords. The PDDH is to monitor and report on human rights issues in the country. His power is only the power of persuasion and publicity. The PDDH can neither prosecute violators nor pass laws. He can only denounce the human rights violations which he observes.\nAccording to LPG, for his new term, Luna has promised to promote creation of units in such areas as the rights of indigenous peoples, HIV-AIDS, rights of immigrants and the creation of an assistant ombudsman for the elderly.\nThe prisons in El Salvador are often referred to as one of the sources of El Salvador's crime problems, not a tool used to reduce crime. El Salvador has a high incarceration rate, with 370 inmates per 100,000 inhabitants. That's 17th out of 217 countries, according to a recent study. (Although only half the rate of #1, the United States, which imprisons 753 persons per 100,000). Read more statistics about the prisons here.\nI highly recommend that anyone interested in present day El Salvador read the report by Linda Garret at the Center for Democracy in the Americas titled Expectations for Change and the Challenges of Governance: The First Year of President Mauricio Funes. The link is to an advance edition which was just released online and has a preface written by Congressman James P. McGovern of Massachusetts. In a clear and readable fashion, this report looks at the accomplishments, the challenges and the shortfalls of Mauricio Funes' first year in office as El Salvador's first left wing president.\nYou can also visit the documentary website which has a 7 minute excerpt from the film, or you can buy a copy of the DVD here.\nAll of El Salvador was shocked today as the country's violence took a horrifying turn. Sunday night in Mejicanos, a suburb of San Salvador, gang members shot at a micro-bus of Route 47, then doused it with gasoline and set it on fire. Fourteen people were burned to death in the bus.\nThe attack took place in a gang-plagued part of the municipality of Mejicanos, just outside San Salvador, National Police Commissioner Carlos Ascencio said. At least 14 people were killed, he said.\nMoments later, gang members opened fire on another bus in the same neighborhood, killing two people.\nWith Tropical Storm Agatha behind them, now able to asses damages and plan for the future, the Movement of Rural Communities Affected by Flooding held a press conference. Representatives of communities located near the lower Lempa, Grande, Jiboa and Paz rivers came together on this rainy, grey Friday morning at the CRIPDES National Office to make a number of concrete demands. These four rivers flooded during Hurricane Ida, and these communities have been among those arguably most affected by hurricanes, rains, flooding and landslides for decades. Representatives included SHARE counterparts CRIPDES San Vicente and ACUDESBAL, who work with communities on the western and eastern banks of the lower Lempa River, respectively.\nThis week El Salvador's Education ministry discussed an ambitious program aimed eventually to have laptop computers in the hands of 800,000 students in poor rural schools.\nThe computers come from the One Laptop Per Child initiative which was formed to place low cost durable laptop computers in the hands of children to jump start education and learning. The XO computer from OLPC is designed specifically for use by children in poor communities around the world.\nAccording to a news report, the government project, called Closing the Knowledge Gap, currently has the computers in the hands of 400 students in five rural schools in Chalatenango. A year from now, the goal is to have the computers in the hands of 78,000 students in 411 schools, and 800,000 students within 4 years. Students can take the rugged little laptop computers home to continue the process of learning with their family.\nAround 100 professional clowns, who make money by performing on public buses, marched through the capital of El Salvador to protest against the killing of a bus passenger by two robbers in clown outfits.\nThe man was shot five times when he declined to give money to two assailants dressed as clowns who boarded a public bus. No-one has been arrested.\nThe protesters marched down San Salvador's main street, holding signs and chanting \"real clowns are not criminals\".\nMore than 75% of the country's homicides are committed with firearms.Every 3 hours someone is killed with a firearm.It is estimated that about 500,000 weapons, legalized or not, are held by the public.More than 57% of the fatalities are people aged 15 to 29 years of age.Since the end of the war in 1992, El Salvador became the 7th largest importer of weapons worldwide whose main market is the United States.There has been a gun control law introduced in El Salvador's National Assembly which Allison classifies as a \"good start\" to addressing the prevalence of gun violence. It's not clear that such a law will pass.\nEl Salvador's Ministry of the Economy released the results of its 2009 study of child labor in Salvadoran households. You can download the complete study at this link. The study is an attempt to measure the level of child labor in El Salvador and the attitudes and circumstances which which contribute to it.\nThe study defines child laborers as children who had worked for at least one hour in the previous week, paid or unpaid, whether for wages or payment in kind, including working in a family enterprise such as a farm or a food stand. The study surveyed 20,000 households in the country.\nThe 2009 report found that roughly 10% of children between the ages of 5 and 17 were working, totalling roughly 189,000 children in El Salvador. The percentages ranged from 1% of children between the ages of 5-9, 10% of children between ages 10-14, and 24% of children between the ages of 15-17.\nIr's always nice to see prominent media taking note of what El Salvador has to offer. The travel section of the New York Times recently wrote: For a small country, El Salvador abounds with attractions: volcanoes, coffee plantations, national parks and a gorgeous Pacific coast.\nThe Times then goes on to describe a possible itinerary for the tourist who wants to spend a week in El Salvador.\nFor more ideas, choose the tourism link on the right side column of this blog.\nSalvadoran president Mauricio Funes completed his first year in office today. Recent public opinion polls show that citizens of the country are generally pleased with their first president from a left wing party.\nWhen asked about Funes' biggest achievement, more than 40% of respondents cited his program to provide free uniforms, shoes, and school supplies to school children throughout the country. Nothing else came close in the poll.", "version": "v0"}

We\u2019ll get the best ship, fill the cargo with foodstuffs and trade goods, hire us some mercenaries (red shirts, cough), waylay\u2026er convince more sailors to join us\u2014and we\u2019ll explore this vast ocean! The bards will sing songs of our exploits for ages to come, and rightly so.\nSpeaking of exploration, we\u2019ve got the beginnings of a new map, which the mighty Kobold Overlord has granted us permission to fill in with our islands, forever making our mark on Midgard! Woot! Take a peek. And to boot, if we meet $6,500 we\u2019ll all get a shiny ocean chart poster map to show off to our player characters.

The Obama win was predicted for some time and doesn\u2019t come as a surprise to me. Intratrade, the stock market, and Nate Silver (The New York Times) all predicted an Obama win. If you want to save yourself some valuable time in the future, those three sources have the highest prediction reliability for national elections. The first two have money on them, while Nate Silver has one of the best statistical methodologies out there.\nWhat comes as somewhat of a surprise to me, though, is how volatile the stock market has become in reaction to the win and the fiscal cliff. The key indicators pegged Obama to win, but the market is still experiencing a big drop over the past month. My guess is that the market is NOT reacting to \u201cjust the Obama win\u201d; rather, it is most likely reacting to a combination of knowns and unknowns.\nWhen the market moves 2% to 5% in a month, I honestly don\u2019t think much about it because it\u2019s relatively common throughout any given year or market cycle. Those pundits who would have you believe otherwise are either feeding on your fear or are simply historically illiterate.\nThe eurozone is front and center again. This is hard to find in U.S. newspapers/apps, but if you turn a few pages, you\u2019ll read that the entire eurozone is still very much a risk.\nUncertainty surrounding the fiscal cliff. As many of you know, if a budget isn\u2019t established, there will be a mandatory $600 billion in spending cuts and tax increases in January. See \u201cWhat is the Fiscal Cliff?\u201d The size of this problem suggests that it is likely another dial mover, but the idea of the fiscal cliff is not a mystery to the markets. \u201cHow\u201d it will play out, though, is.\nUncertainty surrounding tax law changes. It\u2019s possible the capital gains and qualified dividend rates could rise and possibly rise considerably. If that happens, dividend-paying stocks will get hit hard (or are possibly already \u201chit\u201d) to address the fact that after-tax returns on those stocks will go down. So many people are chasing yield these days (See my blog post from last month on this topic) that any bump in the after-tax return will certainly have an impact on the markets.\nOf the items above driving markets today, the one that is the most concerning to me is the potential for radical investment tax law changes. This is highly uncertain and difficult to pin down. I don\u2019t think it should be catastrophic, everything else held equal, but it would not be unreasonable to see a 5% to 10% correction to account for the loss of after-tax wealth if the tax law changes unfavorably.\nEvery moment of the trading day, the stock market is a barometer of future cash flows discounted by the market\u2019s required rate of return. The market today is assuming that both cash flows will be lower, while the risk appears to be higher. That opinion changes every nanosecond and every day.\nIn the long term, the stock market is made up of millions of people directly or indirectly striving to work toward a better place five, 10, or 20 years from now. Assuming these folks are able to do that, the stock market rewards them for waiting that long.\nI don't think the downturn is nearly the mystery you make it. It clearly has to do with the expected tax consequences of a renewed term for this administration that has repeatedly advocated rolling back Bush (now Obama) tax relief measures with increased personal (S Corp) and dividend taxation. The natural response has been a sell-off of equities, before the expected changes go into effect.\nThank you for contributing. I believe that's basically what I said.\nAlthough I don't agree that it's \"clear.\" If one could tell me exactly what the expected changes are in the tax code, we could conclude part of the impact, but markets are too chaotic to assign to one factor.\n1. Earnings are coming in much weaker.\n2. Eurozone ambiguity is bigger than the tax code ambiguity.\n3. The markets were up 17% ahead of the recent correction; retraction is inevitable at some point.\n4. Quantitative easing is not having as much of an impact.\n5. Apple is down 20% from market-peaks; being the largest individual holding of most large cap and hedge funds, it has a dramatic impact on markets.\nAll of these items and then some, drive value.", "version": "v0"}

But alas, she was passed over, and has just one word for whoever was responsible for the casting fiasco: \"Huh?\" she commented on a post from fan account @thedisneyprincesses announcing the Hollywood Bowl performances' cast. Huh, indeed.\nLohan has been the opposite of shy when it comes to expressing her fervent desire to slip into Ariel's fins. In a 2016 interview with a Turkish news channel, she stated that she wouldn't be done with acting until she'd appeared in The Little Mermaid, and a few weeks later, she posted a (since-deleted) photo of her mermaid muse on Instagram, writing \"My dream role,\" and tagging both Disney and Disney Pictures Film in a not-so-subtle hint. More recently, in late 2018, LiLo went a step further, sharing a photo of Ariel and the villainous sea witch Ursula on her Instagram Story, tagging Disney Pictures Film once again, and writing, \"My dream role with Meryl Streep.\"\nAnd in January 2019, fresh on the heels of that incredible pitch, Lohan spoke to Variety about her undying love for the 1989 classic. \"The Little Mermaid is my favorite movie since I was a kid. Whenever I put that movie on, it makes me happy. I'm like, 'Everybody, stop. Watch this movie,'\" she said. Of her continued non-casting in the role, she added: \"I'm going to harass my agent about it after this.\"", "version": "v0"}

LMT is movement-based resistance training that combines full-body, task-oriented movement patterns with load.\nThe Loaded Movement Training originator found that, when his colleagues developed strength and fitness programs for hockey athletes, farm kids had distinct advantages. These young athletes were stronger on the puck, stronger in front of the net when battling their opponents, and stronger in odd body positions. As they worked with young hockey players, the strength differences between farm kids and city kids became so pronounced that they felt compelled to scrutinize what the farm kids were up to.\nhappen with standard weight training or body exercises.\nLoaded movement training can be a missing link in rehab and conditioning. Our bodies evolved to move with loads. Perhaps we should include more loaded movements in our programming.\nConventional strength training exercises most often use weight machines with a cam or pulley to control the path-of-motion of the weight, or free weights such as barbells or dumbbells. Weight machines are designed to place the greatest amount of resistance at the point where a specific muscle is capable of producing the highest magnitude of force during a concentric (shortening) muscle action. Traditional free-weight exercises feature curvilinear joint actions, which typically take place in a single plane of motion where muscles work to generate force directly against the downward pull of gravity.\nenergy necessary for movement (Myers, 2009; Verkoshansky and Siff, 2006).\nfascia rather than compressive loading of the joints.\n* Using a variety of loads combined with different starting positions and movement patterns can improve multidirectional stability, mobility, strength and power. Instead of moving in straight planes, move in the diagonal plane.\nwords, activities of daily living (ADLs).\nMoving with external loads subjects our bodies to various \u201clines of stress\u201d that trigger the remolding of tissue. Most training moves external mass along linear patterns. While this has tremendous benefit, the stimulus is incomplete. Think of multiple, variable lines of stress introduced to a body throwing hay bales versus a repeated set of biceps curls. Both can be tremendously beneficial and lead to function and performance gains. But studies have found that LMT challenges and conditions muscle, fascia, the nervous system, skin and other systems of the body (Hinz 2013; Leonard 1998; Shanahan 2009; Siff 2003). The intention is not to replace current training methods with LMT, but rather to add LMT into a protocol.\nThe barbell squat requires an individual to set his or her feet in parallel and maintain spinal extension and a symmetrical alignment in the hips, while lowering and raising the barbell against gravity. Compare that to a woman spending the day working in her garden; as she\u2019s digging in the dirt she will be performing a variety of different squats with her feet and hips in a variety of different positions. Doing perfectly symmetrical squats in the gym will help improve strength in a specific pattern with an emphasis on concentric muscle action, but it won\u2019t adequately develop her ability to use her fascia to produce and mitigate forces across the entire network, which is what actually happens as she\u2019s going about her chores.\nIn another example, consider how most parents pick up their kids off of the ground; they don\u2019t take the time to set their feet in a neutral position, position their perfectly still child in a symmetrically position relative to his or her midline and then, after bracing, symmetrically load each arm as they pull the child to their chest. As most parents will tell you, there is no cognitive thought relative to their body position as they perform the movement of picking up their child. They simply hold on to their child however they can and lift him/her to whatever position is manageable at the time.\nthat even at the highest levels of performance, many athletes do not perform successive movements exactly the same way. In fact, the highest-level performers actually demonstrate a wide variance in movement patterns when executing a play (Hamill, Palmer and Van Emmerik, 2012; Barlett, Wheat and Robins, 2007; Bartlett, 2008; Stergiou, Harbourne and Cavanaugh, 2006). Loaded movement training allows athletes to develop sport-specific strength by using variable, high-velocity movements corresponding to game-like situations. This helps them to have a greater carryover effect from the conditioning room to the competition arena (Mohammed et al., 2012; Timmons, 2010).\nwe\u2019re already familiar with: Proprioceptive Nueromuscular Facilitation (PNF) and Asymmetrical Loading. Add these techniques to change the outcome of your aquatic sessions.\n* Include spiral and diagonal movement patterns, which are functional to daily life skills.

To learn more about aquatic PNF and gain continuing education credits, complete the course, PNF in the Pool by Terri Mitchell, Julia Meno-Fettig and David Ogden, available at Fitness Learning Systems (http://www.fitnesslearningsystems.com/).\n* Add Asymmetrical Loading (resistance, weighted or buoyancy). Use equipment on only one leg or one arm OR use different loads on each side.\n* Bilateral Upper Extremity (UE) PNF patterns with asymmetrical loads (resistance, weight or buoyancy) in a vertical or horizontal position.\n* Unilateral Lower Extremity (LE) PNF as above.\n* Bend hips and knees as you turn left with a UE PNF pattern, then straighten (extension) with spinal rotation.\n* Squat using UE bilateral horizontal (transverse) adduction/abduction with both arms moving the same direction.\n* Reach left with both arms while walking forward with the head turned R.

Outside of his career and philanthropy, William Deyesso runs a gentleman\u2019s farm in New Hampshire.\nA gentleman\u2019s farm is a small-scale, non-operative farm typically used as a horse or hobby farm or to support a bed and breakfast. While the production of food through plants or raising animals is part of the farm\u2019s operation, it is not the primary means of income for the farmer. The gentleman farmer instead farms for pleasure, rather than production output or profit.\nFarming techniques can vary, but they are often environmentally responsible and are conscious to animal welfare and public health, similar to organic farming. Gentleman farming also differs from the more commonplace large-scale industrial agriculture, which emphasizes efficiency and cost.", "version": "v0"}

It is the cover of Skagos's \u00c1st 2xLP, which is now available from various locations which I've mentioned before, as well as newly available from the band. You can buy either or both editions at the Skagos Bigcartel page, or you can buy it from the Skagos Bandcamp page (in which case you will receive a free download of the album with your purchase).. It should be noted that a purchase of this record directly from the band helps fund the future release of the forthcoming album An-Archic, which I can assure you you'll want to be released sooner than later. (It should also be mentioned that shipping from Canada to Europe is insanely expensive, and that any European friends would be better served to buy this from one of the American labels (Pesanta or Eternal Warfare) that have cooperated to bring this release's physical manifestation to fruition.\nIn any case, I bring this up as it relates to the main thrust of this post - a conversation that I was recently able to have with Ray Hawes about Skagos. The published version of this conversation is long, but I strongly encourage you to read it in its entirety.\nMy deepest appreciation to Ray for speaking with me so openly, honestly, and genuinely about Skagos. Alas, I would guess that he know no other way.\nHSS: First, let me offer you thanks for the opportunity to conduct this interview. Skagos has not typically done a whole lot of press, so I value this greatly. How have you been?\nRay Hawes: And thanks to you for the opportunity to give the entity of Skagos another voice to be heard. It is true that we have shied away from press for the last few years, and I am appreciative for Hammer Smashed Sound to be the medium in which we once again speak out to the world. Your commitment to seeking and sharing meaningful music, as well as your stance with having both feet firmly rooted in the underground has been noted and appreciated by many.\nThere hasn\u2019t seemed to be very much going on with Skagos, in terms of releases, news and updates of any sort, but I have a feeling that much has been going on \u201cbehind the scenes.\u201d What can you say to catch up fans of the band on the upcoming reissue of Ast on a glorious 2xLP? Also, has there been any progress towards the release of An-Archic?\nI\u2019ve been lending much more energy of late to giving more frequent updates to the world at large about our unseen workings, with the hope that those out there that resonate with what we do are not feeling forgotten, or unrecognized. What I can say about the Ast DLP is that I am very excited for this record to receive the presentation that it was always intended to have. At the time of this publication, the album should be readily available. I have heard the test-presses and I can say that the energy and passion that we put in to this record have, at long last, been resolved. It is bewildering for me to think that we wrote and recorded this album in Autumn, four-years-passed. It has certainly been a long, long wait for this to come to fruition.\nThere has been progress towards the release on Anarchic. All movements of music have been completely recorded, polished and mixed for separate formats; the artwork is nearing completion for all different presentation and plans are being solidified for the logistics of the release. The only hindrance at this point is the monetary means to fund the physical manifestation. We\u2019re steadfast in our decision to take the reins of the project and manage our own releases henceforth, but the commitment comes with some major complications regarding funding. The plan as it stands is to release Anarchic with any and all money that comes our way. I imagine that once we receive our copies of the \u00c1st DLPs, the release will not be far off.\nRay, you\u2019ve been involved in various other projects in the past couple of years, such as Iskra and Fauna, and I know that Isaac has his solo project \u201cRain Spirit\u201d as well. Do you both consider Skagos your \u201cmain\u201d musical project, or are the others equally as important? Are you still a member of Fauna?\nI\u2019m not sure that I can categorize Skagos as anything other than what it is. Isaac and I are both individuals prone to leaning on the wind is it comes by, and thusly, we find ourselves involved in many projects, initiatives and activities over a rather vast plain of creative energy. Skagos is a project that is very deeply connected to both of our souls; alas, it is a manifestation of our souls themselves heralding any ears with the capacity to listen; our souls are furthermore a manifestation of the seen and unseen universe at large, whispering and wailing in any language, by any means, utterly unfiltered to whatever harkening audience that lingers long enough to take notice. Thusly, Skagos is simply a piece of our lives at large, but a piece that we choose to share; a piece of the universe at large, which with our voices we share. It can therefore not be classified as a \u201cmain project\u201d, but rather a strong force of a larger presence.\nOr, to answer your question in much fewer words: Yes, while we do consider our other projects to be equally important, Skagos holds a soul-deep commitment within us. We can currently foresee no end to this project, trusting that our hearts still beat.\nAs for whether I am still participating in Fauna or not, the question does not grant a simple yes-or-no answer. My involvement with the magic of Fauna in the past has been undertaken in a gradually accumulative process, at first simply helping with energetic needs and negotiations, leading eventually to full participation in the conjuration of shamanic black-metal atavism. The continuation of this level of involvement will be decided as further events and intentions progress, both logistically and regarding the space within the spiritual vessel of Fauna. There are no absolutes in a journey of this depth.\nA two-part question: I\u2019m not sure occult is the right word, but there seems to be an element of magic, mystery, and perhaps even the supernatural to Skagos. Comment, if you would, on what role these things play for you. On a related note \u2013 I know that ritual is an important aspect of Fauna\u2019s art, and it would seem to have an enormous influence on what Skagos is and does as well. At least, it would if Skagos were a live entity. Are there any plans for Skagos to play live in the future?\nTo answer the first part of your question, these things permeate our work as they enter and are absorbed within our lives. I, myself, live in a world very different than the world of status quo North Americans. To simply view the trees and plants, mountains and oceans, skies and caves, stars and moon of this earth as sentient beings is alarmingly radical fringe thinking to the greater population\u2019s \u201cnormal experience.\u201d To go beyond this, to welcome and recognize the forces, creatures and spirits, those seen and unseen, which intermingle with our immediately experiential plain of existence is then lunacy. Perhaps the most grievous wound to our psyche, the most crippling stagnation, is our devotion to a hyper-rationalistic world-view. I will say, in closing, that in the few truly wild places remaining in this world, our civilized perspectives would be considered an atrophy on the brink of spiritual death.\nAs for the latter half of this answer, there are plans for Skagos to perform in the future. Isaac is currently finding his time almost completely occupied by his participation in the band Half Moon Run, however we do look forward to a time when space is cleared for the actualization of our live intent. And, of course, if this were to transpire (or rather, when it transpires) ritual transcendence will doubtless be a part of the integral whole, whether it is in the passion of heart of the transformation of space.\nI\u2019ve been fortunate enough to hear the early Skagos demos, and considering where you were then, and where you are now, it seems there has been a tremendous maturation in the songwriting and the music itself. Do you think that an accurate perception, and if so, to what do you owe that?\nYes, it is definitely an accurate perception. I can\u2019t remember how old we were when we originally recorded those demos, perhaps sixteen-years-old, maybe freshly seventeen. There has been a substantial amount of maturation between the initial inception and our current workings, and I suppose that is owed most substantially to the linear development of ourselves as people and musicians. When we recorded the demos, we were entirely unsure as to what Skagos was to be, or even what we wanted it to be. We originally wrote an entire full-length demo to be recorded with a tremendous amount of cultivation and control, and after recording a single song we decided to channel an attempt of complete improvisation. Isaac picked up his guitar, I hit record, and the 20-minute piece entitled \u201cseasons\u201d was midwived in to being. Shortly thereafter we realized that our truest potential existed in opening ourselves to the universe at large, to be mouths and tongues through which it speaks a language of tonality, crashes and wails. We have henceforth been largely focusing on our own skill and precision in receiving, comprehending and translating these guided-impulses most purely to the sonic pallet. We often find ourselves looking back at our former work, musically and lyrically, and find ourselves saying things in depths we previously did not even consider, like the intuitive wisdom of children.\nOf course, an amount of credit must be recognized to the unforeseeable procession of the cosmos in which we were honed, broken and sculpted to be the perfect voices for all that we say. We are loosely guided by the hands behind the veil, and by opening to these intentions, we find ourselves inexplicable in the present.\nBlack metal has become increasingly experimental in recent times \u2013 sometimes it\u2019s very good, and sometimes it\u2019s just forced and contrived, and not really experimental at all. Do you find yourselves wanting to experiment with the established sound of black metal?\nCertainly- in fact, I\u2019m not sure we ever had any intention otherwise. I personally find the purism within black metal to be quite perplexing\u2026 black metal itself is a subgenre, an extension beyond pre-existing styles of heavy metal. For any person to claim that it is something particular, that it was always supposed to be that way, and that anything that does not fit to that archetype is false, and thusly not black metal, is purely ridiculous. It is a sort of metaphysical gymnastics to behold someone try and find a common \u201cpurity\u201d within the pioneers of the genre and somehow say that bands like Burzum, Ulver, Immortal, Von, Blasphemy and Enslaved were all spearheading one common idiom, and that is all that is black metal. It is even more absurd to watch different antagonist pick and choose what speaks most clearly to themselves (their egos), label that black metal, and try to cast off the rest as chaff.\nThere is a part of me that empathizes with those who have intent to hold allegiance to a well-honed tradition, to fuel and maintain the integrity of it and to defend against outside forces that wish to sully its precision. This is something that seems to be largely integral to many, many human cultures and subcultures. I am not exempt. However, I don\u2019t believe that black metal as a whole is something that can fit in to this rigorous methodology. The current era of modernity and industrialism that we currently find ourselves living in the midst of now is not one that fiercely defends tradition as human cultures once did, unless it is to protect the state. We live in an age of increasing monocultural complexity, and something like black meal does not escape it. It spirals ever outward in a mad frenzy of creative impulse, leaving no stone unturned. To hear people say that early Darkthrone is black metal but later Darkthrone is not is absurd. For people to say that Conqueror is black metal and Fell Voices is not is ridiculous. Even a band such as Liturgy clearly draws most succinctly from the pre-existing notions of black metal and indeed calls themselves black metal, must of course be a divergence on the periphery of, but not all-together escaping the relativity of black metal. To deny as such is to bury one\u2019s head in the sand. Whether you like it or not, all aforementioned bands clearly find their inception in black metal; nulla cur.\nFor a broader understanding of what I am trying to emphasize above, I suggest reading Scott Schroder\u2019s \u201cThe Emerging Face of God\u201d on his blog, Spring Speaks Truth.\nTell me what these two terms mean to you: Cascadia, and Cascadian Black Metal.\nIt is reassuring to be given space to speak of what these terms mean to me, opposed to discussing their relationship with the world at large.\nFirst and foremost, Cascadia represents, to me, a bioregion- economics, nationalism, homogenized cultural-identity and left-wing coups scarcely enter the periphery of my definitive Weltanschauung regarding the term, and I mention them now, only briefly, to affirm my distance from any such allegiance. To affirm one\u2019s self as an occupant of Cascadia is to affirm Diaspora; to know one\u2019s being in the likeness of a seed borne on the wind. As Perlman put it, \u201c\u2019Central Africa,\u2019 \u2018Australian,\u2019 \u2018America\u2019 are not the names of places where free human beings ever lived. They are the names of unprecedented holocausts, of gigantic colonies, of monstrous Leviathanic trophies. They are the Leviathan\u2019s \u2018empty continents.\u2019\u201d To affirm Cascadia is to affirm solace in ambiguity; to live in reverence and boundless love for the land that has held you since birth, while knowing that you are sprouted from the taproot of genocide; to live in constant awareness of the interconnectivity and measureless relativity of all life, human and non-human, while recognizing that your home is not quite your home; to be horrifyingly present with shedding of Leviathanic armour, and the agonizing rebirth of the inner Wilderness.\nCascadian Black Metal is thusly an affirmation of Leviathan\u2019s paradoxical disintegration. Black Metal itself can be argued to have emerged as a cultural rejection and resistance to the status quo, as it took form in Nordic and European countries. The ideological, aesthetic and musical conceptions were always birthed of a deeply forlorn and wanton knowledge that things were not always as they are, and the shattering horror that we may never again know what has been lost to us, howling in cacophony the death-throws of the human animal. \u201cThe screaming of the captive is the voice of God.\u201d Norse Black Metal can be characterized as anti-Christian, anti-Roman, anti-Abrahamism, probing the depths of longing for the atrophied roots of their dwindling past, recognized only through a superficial veneer. As this movement moved to America, it was often characterized by and presented as formless despair, the completely misanthropic disdain for human life, or the formulated rejection of anything but nondescript sorrow, as distilled most succinctly in the DSBM and USBM scene (of course this is not an all-encompassing observation, merely a relative example.) This nondescript despair is the blind certainty that one\u2019s soul is lost, while never knowing so; never knowing what is lost, only knowing the aching hole it has left. Henceforth, Cascadian Black Metal has been a vaulting point from the stepping-stones laid by our dispossessed contemporaries, to probe the harrowing depths of Diaspora, and to perhaps finally stumble upon the flickering candle of life in the infinite voids and chasms of modernity- a somnambulant stupor over the smoldering coals of atavism.\nI don\u2019t know how many of your listeners pick up on this, but as I\u2019ve read Against His-story, Against Leviathan about 40 times, I\u2019m very familiar with the anarcho-primitivist author Fredy Perlman, and notice that he\u2019s played a big part in your song titles and lyrics for quite some time. Perlman and his work have made a huge impact on my life, personally - can you tell us how he came to influence your thought and your music and songwriting so significantly?\nI\u2019m pleased to hear that the obsession is shared. Perlman\u2019s works and perspectives have changed my life in such profound ways, and continue to with every day that passes. To be completely honest, I first encountered word of his existence through the Leech demo, \u201cAgainst Leviathan!\u201d I looked in to the title, and began to research both the essay, as well as Perlman, himself. It was soon after that I happened across a copy of Against His-Story, Against Leviathan! in Victoria\u2019s infoshop, Camas. I began to read the book that same day, and though it was difficult for me to fully grasp the vastness of the narrative and depths of the concepts at the time, I was nonetheless inspired and floored by the analysis of civilization found within. To this day, I continue to reread the work every so often with my head brimming with new ideas and fresh perspectives on the world around me, looking to challenge him with these ideas, and find that Perlman has already touched base on them in some way.\nIt was only natural for a work of this kind to influence Skagos so heavily, as the exploration that we seek to undertake within the project follows so closely with the intent of Against Leviathan. I truly find it difficult to speak of the topics that I do through lyricism and song titling without using the terminology found within that book, as it has encapsulated my world-view to such an extent that I feel hindered trying to avoid them; for example, referencing the binary concepts of mythic-power-dynamics and modern dichotomies of consumption and creation, falseness and truth, without the aid of Ahriman and Ahura Mazda; or to encapsulate the untouchable immensity of the current human condition without using the metaphor of Leviathan. It has permeated every depth of our lyricism.\nThe Earth is changing in unprecedented ways \u2013 some would even contend that the Earth is dying, being killed by man and by civilization. Recent evidence even suggests that we have passed the point of no return, and that collapse is imminent. What role does ideology play for Skagos? Is there a message, or is it a purely personal endeavor?\nAt an earlier time I would have had a very different answer for this question, but my perspectives are undergoing radical changes of late, especially regarding this vein of thought. There was a time when ideology was paramount to Skagos\u2019 role, however I would be more inclined to say, now, that ideology is a set of personally stagnating bias, developed as a way of marginalizing and disconnecting with one\u2019s openness of experience in the world. The only precise answer I can offer in this time of transition is thus: I do not know. And perhaps this is perfect answer for the second part to your question, in short. What I mean is that Skagos has unfolded to be an aural documentation of our journey as people to reclaim the integrity and beauty of our souls, in these times of, as you put it, unprecedented change. If there are any messages to be gleaned from our music, it is the ideas and emotions that can be offered to our listeners, intentional or otherwise. We seek to explore and reclaim our mythic being, and welcome all who find us unto the fold.\n\u201cAnamnesis II \u2013 A Dry, Sterile Thunder, Without Rain\u201d, from the Panopticon split, contains lines from TS Eliot. Besides Eliot and Fredy Perlman, what artists past and present \u2013 writers, musicians, visual artists, etc. \u2013 do you find inspirational, and which, if any, do you find influencing your music and your lives?\nTo answer for our lives would be a different question all together, so I will answer purely from the standpoint of Skagos. Of course, so many of the artists that pass in out of our perspective influence our daily lives, but of late I am finding the project most inspired by writers such as Scott Schroder, Paul Sheppard, Reginald A. Ray and Ursula Leguin. The influence of musicians would be an extensive list, but I can suggest Fauna, Sacrificial Totem, and the inner circle of Oneiria, as well as Locrian and Merkstave. From a slightly different direction, the offerings of Bob Dylan and Godspeed You! Black Emperor have been enormously influential. However, despite this all, I feel that we are most inspired by the living, breathing, enthralling world around us, waking and unwaking, all plains and dimensions.\nHatred has always been a staple of black metal, but what does love mean to your music?\nI\u2019m not sure how best to address a topic this encompassing. Perhaps that, in and of itself, is the answer. I can say that my view of hatred is seen as a complete lack of trust and openness to the universe around one\u2019s self. Love, on the other hand, is the complete faith in all that confronts our experience; even so far as recognizing those things that we loathe, to be universal providence acting unto our becoming as true human beings. \u00c1st dealt largely with this topic, the title itself being an Old Norse word for deepest intuitive Love.\nYou\u2019ve said that you\u2019ll be self-releasing all future Skagos material. How important is the DIY attitude and practice to Skagos? What format do you predict your releases will see?\nYes, this is our intention. I don\u2019t believe that it is a particular commitment to anything that can be labeled as a \u201cDIY attitude\u201d that fuels this decision, but rather the desire for a more intimate relationship with the entity of Skagos as a whole that propels us forward. We desire to be personally linked to the production, presentation and distribution of the work borne of our souls. We have nothing but appreciation and love for the individuals and organizations we have worked with in the past, however it is time for us to take these fateful steps elseward. We may yet still work with certain labels or initiatives in the future, however these endeavors will be exceptions to the norm in the spirit of collaboration, rather than fiscal inability.\nWhat does it mean to you for Skagos to be \u201csuccessful?\u201d In other words, since record sales are not the driving force behind Skagos, at what point do you consider this a successful band?\nthanks for this!! exactly what i was searching for.", "version": "v0"}

Considering its English origins, it was in my opinion, till some time back was a meal offering cereals, eggs, breakfast rolls, salads, mains and desserts; but now the brunch barring some star hotels do not feature any breakfast items. These days it is more synonymous with a lazed out lunch with timings extended to 1600 hrs in most cases and where fancy cocktails and wines are an inclusive feature. My brunch today was one such lazed-out one at the Punjab Grill, a modern Indian restaurant in Juhu.\nThis was my second visit at their Juhu outlet; first one was for their beautiful winter menu promotion a couple of months back. From that evening of a glamorous candle lit setting in the chill of January to a beautiful idyllic setting in the warm and breezy afternoon of March today; the outdoor setting is a huge plus (till another fortnight, the weather will kill it).\nWhat does the Brunch include?\nChaat items like Dhai Bhalla, Palak ki chaat, Pani puris etc were tastefully made and set up my appetite. The tandoori starters of Subz Seek, tandoori veggies and Paneer were all smoked up and rich. The main course was pretty commonplace and missed the wow element of the brand. A creamy but lack of spice in the black dal was disappointing and the same was with the paneer makhani. The veggie biryani was done with long grains of very fragrant basmati. All of it was washed down with a zesty red wine sangria, I must say I was pretty impressed with it.\nIt was time for desserts, the aroma of fresh jalebi had filled the promenade outside the restaurant, and I had made my mind to gobble quite a few before even entering the place. Jalebi and rabdi and kesar firni were brilliant, the Gajrela and Moong dal halwa good and the innovative rasmalai in toffee was a tad too sweet, couldn\u2019t go beyond a lick!!\nOverall a great buffet with good choice, good food and comes at a great price.

But groups like Campus Progress, better groomed and better organized than their predecessors, are pushing back.\nThe assumption that America\u2019s campuses are impenetrable bastions of liberalism\u2013where left-leaning faculty predominate, progressive student activism flourishes and conservatism is fiercely marginalized\u2013still rules the day. But in reality, since the 1970s the conservative movement has become the dominant political force on many American campuses. This sea change is not simply a reflection of some students\u2019 increasingly right-wing views. Each year, conservative groups pour more than $35 million into hundreds of college campuses. They pay for right-wing speakers, underwrite scores of student papers, provide free leadership training and cushy internships, and equip thousands of new activists with talking points, discipline and missionary zeal.\nIt\u2019s a familiar lament among the two dozen student progressives I talked with for this article. But help has arrived. After three decades of unanswered advances by the right, the progressive movement is no longer leaving students to fend for themselves. Campus Progress\u2013a project of the Center for American Progress (CAP), one of the country\u2019s premier think tanks\u2013is the largest of a handful of organizations that have emerged in the past year to counter the right\u2019s campus operations. These groups are offering resources, ideas and training designed to patch up many of the holes that have long deflated the student left. But in attempting to forge a widespread student progressive movement, they face many of the same quandaries that loom large for American progressivism as a whole: What values should define the movement? What tactics should be embraced? And perhaps most difficult of all, to what extent does striving for results mean sacrificing strong principles?\nMeanwhile, student conservatives have managed to balance organizational and ideological discipline with ragtag rebelliousness, positioning themselves as perpetual underdogs on oppressively liberal campuses. Armed with their version of a screw-the-man mentality, the student right\u2019s activism is often shocking: affirmative action bake sales where white students are charged more for cookies than blacks, for instance, or immigrant hunts where students dressed in Border Patrol uniforms chase targeted \u201cillegals\u201d with water guns. As tasteless and offensive as such stunts might be, they make waves on campuses and garner national attention for the movement.\nFor progressive student activists, attention-getting victories have also been scarce. There have been isolated triumphs in the past year: successful student-led living-wage campaigns for employees at Georgetown University and Washington University of St. Louis, and the multi-campus Taco Bell boycott, which helped secure a significant raise for the fast-food chain\u2019s tomato pickers.\nFrustrations abound, but the emergence of national progressive organizations on campus has given many student activists renewed hope. In its first year Campus Progress has provided progressive students with tools they\u2019ve never had before: money and a sense of unity. While its $1.25 million projected budget falls well below the more than $10 million of the right-wing Young America\u2019s Foundation, Campus Progress has made an immediate impact. Wayne Huang, editor of Cornell\u2019s student progressive publication, Turn Left, has seen his paper \u201cgo through a shocking transformation in little under a year,\u201d thanks to funding from Campus Progress. On twenty-seven other campuses, formerly cash-strapped student left publications are finally competing with conservative papers, publishing regularly and printing on high-quality paper. At its virtual meeting place, CampusProgress.org, students from across the country are sharing ideas and getting advice on how to communicate their values from the likes of Senator Barack Obama. Features like \u201cKnow Your Right-Wing Speakers\u201d and \u201cCrib Sheet\u201d provide concise talking points for fighting the right.\nAs Campus Progress works to build a national community for student progressives, Young People For (YP4) focuses on developing individual leaders. A project of People for the American Way, YP4 mirrors the right\u2019s Leadership Institute, which has trained more than 40,000 young conservatives, including movement heavyweights Ralph Reed and Grover Norquist, since its inception in 1979. Providing a leadership pipeline for the left, YP4 has trained 126 students on forty campuses in its first year.\nThe largest Baptist university in the world has not yet passed a living wage for its workers, but Parker and her fellow activists are making headway with 1 John 3. They convinced the Student Congress to pass a resolution calling for a living wage, and have motivated 600 students to send postcards to the university president supporting the campaign.\nProgressives organized the most widely publicized student protest of 2005, the Princeton Frist-a-Buster. What began as a small event staged by eight students in front of the Frist Campus Center\u2013each student took turns reading out of the campus phone book to protest Senate majority leader Bill Frist\u2019s threat to abolish the filibuster for judicial nominees\u2013quickly grew into a nationwide phenomenon. Hundreds of students and professors, a Nobel laureate and two US senators took turns reading everything from Shakespeare to 3,500 digits of pi at Princeton, while students at thirty-five other campuses staged copycat events.\nBut in choosing which student activities to support, which publications to finance and which speakers to bring on tour, Campus Progress can\u2019t help pushing an ideology. Some worry that the organization, run in part by former Clinton Administration officials, is more interested in promoting a centrist agenda than a strong, progressive alternative to the campus right. Several students who attended last summer\u2019s National Student Conference\u2013where the keynote speaker was none other than Bill Clinton\u2013felt that truly progressive perspectives were lacking. One panel, \u201cStronger and Smarter National Security,\u201d featured three panelists who, despite their criticism of George W. Bush\u2019s handling of the war, advocated expanding the military presence in Iraq. The subject of withdrawing troops was not even broached.\nHalperin insists that Campus Progress is eager to bring students across the left\u2019s spectrum into the fold. If the ideological diversity of the students at the conference was limited, he chalks that up to the fact that Campus Progress recruited a large portion of the attendees from the DC-based progressive organizations where many work as interns. The 2006 conference, he vows, will reflect a broader outreach.\nNot all of the major efforts to organize campus progressives are coming from the outside. The Roosevelt Institution, founded by Stanford University students in the wake of the 2004 presidential election, is billed as the nation\u2019s first progressive student think tank. Providing much of Roosevelt\u2019s steam is executive director Quinn Wilhelmi, an ambitious and ultra-enthusiastic junior who quotes Spider-Man and Henry David Thoreau in the same breath. His message\u2013that progressive students can and should be fighting in the war of ideas\u2013is resonating with thousands of students across the country; the Roosevelt Institution already boasts chapters at 120 campuses.\nIn early October students from across the country met in Washington to present policy recommendations at the House office building\u2019s Cannon caucus room. Debuting their policy journal, the Roosevelt Review, students held forth on relatively mainstream topics ranging from AIDS prevention to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge crisis. At the launch of Yale\u2019s Roosevelt chapter this fall, students donned formal attire, nibbled on fancy hors d\u2019oeuvres and watched a prerecorded video appearance from Hillary Clinton.\nWilhelmi says that the Roosevelt Institution is not an attempt to replace grassroots activism but rather to complement it. \u201cNothing would have happened in the \u201960s without the sit-ins, but nothing would have happened without the Civil Rights Act either,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope students will do both. I hope they\u2019ll do the sit-ins and then also work toward getting a city government to pass a law.\u201d He also maintains that Roosevelt will be a \u201cbig tent\u201d for progressive ideas. Even though the organization is courting DLC darling Hillary Clinton, it has Nation editor Katrina vanden Heuvel and liberal philosopher Richard Rorty on its advisory board.\nThe right has created a student movement not simply by providing infrastructure but by promoting hard-core conservative ideology on campuses. The fledgling effort to organize campus progressives has provided the much needed infrastructure. But if progressive students are encouraged to embrace pragmatic politics over bold and sweeping challenges to the status quo, could something else\u2013something essential\u2013be lost? After all, radical students have stood at the forefront of many critical battles in this country, propelling social change by refusing to think within the accepted boundaries of debate. What will it mean for the progressive movement in the long run if cries for a new society are replaced by calls for incremental improvement? Is the future of the progressive movement better off in the hands of young pragmatists or young visionaries?", "version": "v0"}

This is the chocolate cake of my childhood \u2013 if there was a flavour profile for childhood celebrations, this would be it. It is also my Dad\u2019s favourite and he visited for a whole 24 hours this week. So I made it to celebrate his unexpected trip.

I gave him slices in a tupperware to eat whilst in transit. The rest I took to the office.\nThis is a lighter chocolate cake than the one I made for A\u2019s birthday.

It is simple to put together, although I seemed to use more bowls than I would like (washing up elves!), but I suspect this was just because I was being thorough. Or some such.\nLine two 22cm tins with butter and baking paper. Preheat the oven to 180C.\nWhisk the cocoa powder with the boiling water and set aside. Whisk the egg whites with the salt until stiff. (Hold-it-over-your-head-and-the-mixture-doesn\u2019t-move-kind-of-stiff.) Mix the flour, sugar and baking powder together. Whisk the egg yolks, oil and vanilla together lightly, just to emulsify.

(Be sure to scrape the bottom of the bowl so you don\u2019t end up with any dregs of flour making an unexpected appearance as you pour the batter into the tins.) I like to whisk this part and then switch to a spatula to fold in the whites.\nFold the egg whites into the mixture in two batches. Be gentle with the second batch \u2013 you don\u2019t want to knock too much air out. Divide the mixture between the two tins and bake for about 30 minutes, until a skewer inserted comes out clean. Allow to cool completely before icing.\nFor the icing, combine 170g softened, unsalted butter with 390g icing sugar and 2 tbsp cocoa powder. Mix on a low speed until it all comes together. Add in a few splashes of milk and once combined, beat on a high speed until smooth and gloopy. This will make enough to fill and ice the cake.", "version": "v0"}

It's been DPD policy to alert the FBI civil rights office about any and all officer shootings since the shooting death of James Harper late last year.\nBut this morning a preliminary panel of the Dallas Ethics Advisory Commission dismissed the complaint. Not because both DPD and the FBI confirm that the department does in fact report all officer-related shootings, but because Flanagan isn't technically a Dallas resident. She lives in DeSoto, and the regulations for ethics complaints require that the person filing the complaint either live in Dallas or have some business dealings there.\n\"That's the jurisdictional requirement for filing an ethics complaint,\" says City Attorney Tom Perkins.\nSo Flanagan has no grounds to bring an ethics complaint, despite the fact that the incident happened in Dallas and involved a DPD officer. The FBI has confirmed that DPD has indeed been contacting them about officer shootings, Allen's included.\nThe incident happened at an apartment complex in March, where police say Allen was threatening his girlfriend before trying to choke Staller. He shot Allen multiple times.

Thankfully, serious and permanent damage to your back is very rare. However, even a minor back strain can be very painful and can affect your daily activities, sometimes causing people to take time off work.\nYour spine is one of the strongest parts of your body. It is reinforced by strong ligaments and powerful muscles which provide strength and flexibility to your back.\nWhile X-rays and MRIs are useful in detecting serious injuries, they can often be misleading. You may have heard the word \u2018degeneration\u2019 being mentioned. These are normal changes that happen with age, like wrinkles on your skin or grey hair. It does not refer to damage or arthritis.\nYour doctor of physiotherapist often may not be able to pinpoint exactly what is causing your back pain, which can be frustrating. This is usually a sign there is no serious damage to the spine.\nMost pain comes from the muscles, ligaments and small joints in your back. Your back was designed for movement and needs lots of movement to stay healthy and pain-free. When the back is not moving and working enough, it can become deconditioned. By moving the back again, it helps the back to recover.\nAt West Limerick Physiotherapy and Neuro Rehabilitation Clinic our experienced Chartered Physiotherapists can help to identify the cause of your back pain or rule out any serious injury.\nWe also offer private treatment rooms for individual attention, hands-on treatment approach and convenient parking.\nJessie Ryan 2017, Chartered Physiotherapist, MISCP.\nTSO.

Insurers know they have an advantage in cases where the liability of their insured is fairly apparent if they can settle the claim prior to the injury victim finishing treatment or obtaining legal advice. However, the insurance carrier\u2019s settlement always comes with important strings attached.\nInjury victims will be asked to execute a General Release of Liability or similar document. A release of this type usually waives claims that are known and unknown. Car accident victims who fall into this trap for the unwary could waive their right to pursue claims for injuries that have not even been diagnosed. Since you cannot know what additional medical procedures or injuries could become necessary down the road, car crash claims usually should not be settled until your doctors have determined you have reached your maximum recovery and you have discussed the matter with a personal injury attorney. Individuals who experience injury in a motor vehicle accident may likely regret settling a car accident claim without speaking to an attorney to obtain advice about their legal rights, the possible value of their claims.\nWhile personal injury victims are not required to retain an attorney, insurance companies recognize they have a significant advantage when they deal with an unrepresented party. The legal process is complex and confusing, so an insurer with a team of insurance defense attorneys, adjusters, investigators, and significant litigation resources will exploit its massive advantage in resources, experience, knowledge, and manpower. When you retain our Atlanta personal injury attorneys, you can shift the scales of justice back in your direction.\nSome car accident victims make the mistake of assuming they can trust information provided by an insurance adjuster or other representatives of the insurance carrier. Insurance adjusters may seem friendly and helpful, but they are not on your side. Their financial interest is aligned with the carrier that pays their salary. When you are told that retaining an attorney will reduce your recovery because of legal fees, the adjuster normally knows that statistics show represented clients usually receive substantially more than self-represented injury victims. A study conducted by the Insurance Research Council (a pro-insurance industry organization) found that personal injury plaintiffs with an attorney settled their case for an average of 3.5 times more than plaintiffs who settled directly with the insurance company. The disparity in the settlements even allowed for the amount paid in attorney fees. The pathway through the litigation and insurance claims process is filled with obstacles and traps for the unwary, but our experienced personal injury attorneys guide our clients along this treacherous path.\nIf you or a loved one has been injured in an auto accident caused by someone else's negligence, contact Montlick & Associates today for your free consultation with our experienced Georgia motor vehicle accident lawyers.

But the fallout keeps growing. Today an outside law firm hired by the Wells board released a tough-talking report that put the onus chiefly on the banks\u2019 former retail chief, Carrie Tolstedt (Reuters).\nWells said it would penalize Tolstedt and former CEO John Stumpf a total of $75 million more than it already has. These penalties are known on Wall Street as \u201cclawbacks.\u201d The label makes them sound difficult and unpleasant, which is exactly what executives want the world to think they are.\nMike Cagney, right, CEO of SoFi.\nMike Cagney, the CEO of financial services startup SoFi, does not lack for confidence. But then again, confidence is what you need to raise billions of dollars and take on some of the largest and most powerful companies in the world\u200a\u2014\u200aglobal financial giants like Chase, Citi, and Bank of America.

If we\u2019re lucky, the rustle of investors fleeing Deutsche Bank late this week will prove to be a minor hiccup in the world of capital. If we\u2019re unlucky, it will be the first domino to fall in another wave of financial disaster like the one we experienced in 2008. Deutsche Bank\u2019s recent round of woes started with a $14 billion fine by the U.S. government for the bank\u2019s sale of mortgage-backed securities during that last bank crisis, which sent investors for the doors (Fortune). Along with the recent scandal at Wells Fargo, which revealed that thousands of its employees had for years been opening fake accounts to meet sales incentives, Deutsche Bank\u2019s problems remind us that, as a result of hard lessons learned a decade ago, our banking system\u2019s safety protections got some upgrades, but they haven\u2019t actually been tested yet. And if they\u2019re not up to the next crisis, then we\u2019re all going to be stuck paying the price\u200a\u2014\u200aagain.\nWhen is a poll not a poll? When it\u2019s an online survey in which anyone can vote and vote again. One of the foundations of data science took a beating in the political arena this week, as Donald Trump crowed over his wins in snap post-debate online \u201cpolls\u201d even as the real polls started tilting in his opponent\u2019s favor (CNN). Real polls, scientific ones, try to map the reality of public opinion through a process of weighted sampling. You might only ask 1000 people what they think; but if those thousand respondents match the national population in race and religion, party affiliation, income, and so on\u200a\u2014\u200aor, if they don\u2019t, you weight them a bit so they do\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019ve got a snapshot of something real. But if you just open the tap on the internet and ask anyone to vote, your results are nearly worthless. Trump\u2019s wins are like Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf\u2019s victory in People\u2019s \u201cMost Beautiful People\u201d online poll; a self-selected sample is just a gauge of partisan excitement level. In a larger sense, this overvaluing of online polls reflects our deeper confusion over how to use all kinds of metrics. By turning yardsticks into targets, we break them (Quartz). Your poll becomes someone else\u2019s campaign; your Key Performance Indicator stops telling you anything useful because everyone in your organization is trying to game it. Without context and understanding, raw data is worse than useless\u200a\u2014\u200ait can be toxic.\nWhat\u2019s at stake in the automation-prediction game. \u201cIntelligent agents\u201d is what we called them, once upon a time, these programs that would perform tasks for us without our telling them. And that sounded great! An agent works for you, right? But now those software bots have joined up with hardware robots, drones, and autonomous vehicles. And if a new report from the Forrester research outfit is right, they might be putting us out of work (The Guardian). Forrester says that, \u201cby 2021, a disruptive tidal wave will begin\u201d: Robots will already have eliminated 6 percent of U.S. jobs\u200a\u2014\u200astarting with customer service reps and taxi and truck drivers\u200a\u2014\u200aand more will quickly follow. If true, it\u2019s a grim prognosis: We don\u2019t have nearly enough public resources in place to retrain that volume of unemployed workers or to give them a safety net. But wait! Here\u2019s another report, this one from Goldman Sachs (Bloomberg), that says not to worry: We\u2019ve survived similar industrial transitions before, and they will open all kinds of new opportunities for those who know where to look. We just need the government and other public institutions to manage the transition in a smart way. That\u2019s when you might take a look at our deadlocked Congress and trivialized presidential election\u200a\u2014\u200aand wince.\nBig Ag keeps getting bigger. Bayer\u2019s $56 billion buyout of Monsanto, if approved by regulators, will further consolidate the hold of a handful of agro-chemical industrial giants on the world\u2019s food supply, writes Brad Plumer in Vox. Monsanto holds a big slice of the global seed market, but its trademark Roundup-Ready GMO crops are already losing ground, as bugs gain resistance to the pesticide. The BigCos engaged in this frantic mating dance\u200a\u2014\u200anot just Bayer/Monsanto but Dow/Dupont, Syngenta/ChemChina and others\u200a\u2014\u200aare all betting that the bigger they are, the better they\u2019ll be able to influence governments and regulators in their favor. They might be right. But global consolidation only deepens the industry\u2019s commitment to the path of mammoth monoculture, even if that hasn\u2019t worked so well for Monsanto\u2019s pesticide-resistant crops. If we hope for sustainable diversity in our food supply, we may need a little more of it in the companies that support our farmers, too.", "version": "v0"}

It handles Latin America\u2019s third largest container volume after Brazil and Panama.\nWith the first phase of the terminal complete, APM Terminals L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas has a quay of 750 meters in length for ships and a depth of 16.5 meters - deep enough to receive some of the world\u2019s largest container vessels now in service.\n\u201cAutomation will improve efficiency \u2013 and this topic is very important in the history of Mexico and Latin America,\u201d says Vice-Admiral Jorge Luis Cruz Ballado, Director General of the L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas port.\nBy the final phase of the terminal buildout, which is expected between 2027 and 2030, its alongside depth will increase to 18 meters and it will have a 1.5 km-long quay, with an annual throughput capacity of 4.1 million TEUs.\n\u201cMexico is a core part of our strategy of investing in growth markets and building state-of-the-art facilities to run more efficiently the supply chain from the heart of Mexico to Asia and the rest of the Americas,\u201d says APM Terminals Mexico Managing Director Jose Rueda.\nSanchez used to work operating cranes on board vessels, and was keen to join APM Terminals as they developed the port. He signed in December and since then has been busy with training and now already receiving vessels, as the port gears up for full operations.\nHe is from L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, a city of some 180,000 people which is gradually being transformed by the presence and investment from the port as well as other industry, including an ArcelorMittal steel plant. It is linked by intermodal rail to the US rail network and to Mexico\u2019s most important consumer market, Mexico City.\nThe port received its first official vessel call in February with the arrival of the 9,600 TEU capacity Maersk Salalah on the AC2 Transpacific service from Asia.

We cannot speak about sin on the basis of ethics, which would reduce guilt to intention and moral responsibility: as if we did not feel guilt having caused someone elses death or pain, as if Dostoevskij was wrong by having told us that we are all responsible for everyones fault. According to ethics, sin would not ever be embodied as a beast crouching at your door, spying and willing to have you (Gn 4,7).\nBiblical sin is similar to disease and in the New Testament healing from sin is not different from healing from disease. As illness may be caused by a deliberate behavior, such as going to extremes, which is strictly connected to personal responsibility, so is the sin: however they are both fearful because they can act far beyond this boundary, by striking blindly, widening and infecting everyone. We tend to conceive moral obligation as a universal necessary constant rather than like a historical invention, just because we are used to taking our past experience as the absolute, and that is due to a lack of historical perspective. Ancient Jews have never taken Mosaic laws as a moral code. In fact they never felt the writs we call ritual to be worse or different than the ones we call moral writs. By the way, even in the New Testament the fundamental commandments of baptizing and celebrating Eucharist have the same ritual feature as circumcision in the Old Testament. However, the Mosaic laws do not bind because of their rational need but because they come from Gods authority, the King of Israel: God can command not to kill but he can also command to slaughter entire peoples (Dt 7, 1-2).\nthat Jesus walks alongside them!\nRecently I had the opportunity to listen to you at a meeting that had been organized by a group of homosexual believers from Milano and I was very smitten by your attitude with regard to homosexuality. Rather than repeat the positions of condemnation, based on a negative vision of human sexuality, you preferred reminding us of the duty that we have, that of constructing an authentic spirituality. In what way can your attitude be included in the Orthodox tradition?\nUnderstand that the Orthodox tradition is not so much that which we have before our eyes: the meaning of things is in the Messianic future, because only in that future do things get their light and foundation. The goal is the origin, and not the origin the goal. If this is missing, the past is merely the conservation of what is existing and, with that, one does not get anywhere. The canonic and dogmatic tradition of the great councils is based on Faith in Christ. It's incredible! Man pushes away his brother, a man like him, when he is poor and impure, while the Lord, like a loving mother towards her son, forgives everything and pushes no sinner away. On the contrary! He gives him the Holy Spirit.\nTherefore, to a homosexual who asks you what must he do to implement the will of God in his life, you suggest above all that he listen to his own conscience which is, after all, the place in which the Spirit of God manifests itself to man?\nI would tell him to listen to God who is manifested in Jesus Christ. He is infinitely meek, compassionate and good. And when the soul knows him, it stands astonished and exclaims: \"What a Lord we have!\". If even I, despite my unworthiness, can put myself in contact with him, I believe that anyone can do it! Understand this! I do not think that homosexuals are different from any other persons: certainly they are more persecuted and this brings them closer to Him. In my existential experience with Him, I had the certainty of being completely accepted and of being fully loved. But I cannot communicate this certainty with words! Perhaps, to explain myself better, I can say that, more than acceptance, one should speak of Love, of that very strong and intoxicating experience which is the discovery of being loved by Jesus. An experience which, when it happens, one spends the rest of their life weeping over it.\nIt seems to me that that which you are proposing to homosexual persons is more of a spiritual journey than a moral discourse: it is an evocative choice which, however, runs the risk of not being understood in a country such as ours, in which religious experience is often reduced to a series of ethical principles which are obligatory throughout the life of the believer. Do you not see this danger?\nIf this were true it would be very serious! To reduce religion to morality is one of the signs of the Antichrist! The vetero-testamentary and evangelical ethic is an heteronomous ethic, that is, it is an ethic that depends on God and is therefore not an autonomous ethic which depends upon man or his reason. It is necessary to distinguish the fault from the sin: the fault is what it is because of a law and laws are often arbitrary and made by men. Biblically, sin is not doing the will of God and not establishing that which is the will of God for each single man means not recognizing the mystery which there is inside each one of us. Jesus does not concern himself with the proclamation or the realization of new ethical ideals, nor does he concern himself with proclamations regarding his own goodness (Mt. 19:17), that which is closest to His heart is love for the actual man. Therefore he can enter into communion with the fault of men and to bear upon himself this burden. Jesus does not wish to appear, at the expense of men, as the only perfect individual, he does not want to be the only man without fault, who watches with disgust a humanity which gives into sin, he does not wish that any idea of a new man triumphs over the ruins of a humanity destroyed through its own fault. Regarding homosexuality, within Christianity, there have been amassed accusing moral judgments that have branded the homosexual psychology and have exasperated behaviours for the worse. The sole ethic that I feel like recommending is that of the sharing of human suffering, wherever and however one finds it.", "version": "v0"}

My number one suggestion for dealing with the confusion of Photo Viewer is simply to turn it off. Picasa Web Albums, a companion service, was closed on May 1, 2016. The app seems to create albums automatically based on time, location, and what it detects in the picture? Picasa is free photo editing software from Google that makes your pictures look great.

The Picasa 64 bit version was specifically designed for 64 bit Windows Operating Systems and performs much better on those. It also offers several basic photo editing functions, including color enhancement, reduction, and. The image was still the wrong color.\nWhen you launch Picasa, you can immediately organize and edit the photos on your hard drive. I would recommend to get Adobe Lightroom for the professional stuff and use Windows Photo for quick view. There can be a dozen reasons why we may need to edit a few pictures, for example getting rid of a red eye, or cropping away unnecessary parts of the image. I also use it to quickly edit and save screenshots. You see \u2014 the picture is still coming from the email. I need my images to show up the correct colors everywhere like any normal photo you download on the internet.\nIn July 2004, Google acquired Picasa from Lifescape and began offering it as.

When you signed up for a new cellphone contract or a signed a contract with your cable or satellite provider, chances are the company did a hard inquiry.\nWhen it comes to applying for credit there are two types of inquiries: hard inquiries and soft inquiries. Soft inquiries won't show up on your credit report, but hard inquiries do show up on your credit report and can be very damaging. A soft inquiry can often occur without your knowledge and are used to check your credit score and other background information, such as your credit utilization and debt-to-income ratio. For example, if you've ever been pre-approved for a mortgage or credit card, it was because the company performed a soft inquiry.\nConversely, a hard inquiry occurs when you personally apply for credit and the company checks your score before making any final lending decisions. These hard inquiries will stay on your credit report for two years, and if you have several hard inquiries on your report, it can dramatically impact your score.\nGoing through the legal process of a divorce will not impact your credit score. However, if you and your former spouse are both legally and financially obligated to pay a bill, such as your mortgage or credit cards, you will be held liable.\nUnfortunately, if you file for a divorce and your former spouse doesn't keep up with their obligations, the late payments, collection activity and lawsuit will also show up on your credit report. In many cases, one of the spouses will not be aware of the negative impact on their credit score until some severe, costly damage is done.\nFrom the age of your credit history to your credit utilization, there are several factors that make up your credit score. One of these factors that many people aren't aware of is the types of credit. Typically, there are three types of credit that most consumers will utilize: installment account, revolving account and an open account.\nA revolving account means that you don't pay the same amount every month. The most common example is a credit card. A car payment or mortgage payment are two examples of an installment account, which is an account that requires you pay the exact same amount of the total balance every month. An open account must be paid fully each month. One type of an open account is a cellphone bill.\nIf your credit score only features one type of credit account, it can actually hurt your score. One of the best ways to raise your credit score is to have a mix of all three types of accounts. This shows potential lenders that you are able to handle the responsibility of paying each type of bill.\nFinally, there is one common and surprising way that many Americans damage their credit: improperly cancelling their gym membership. Many gyms make their clients sign a contract that states they will pay monthly to utilize the facility. Unfortunately, if you decide to stop going to the gym and do not honor that contract, the gym will report your late or skipped payments to the three credit bureaus.\nIf you are planning on quitting your gym, make sure you go through the proper cancellation procedure. Otherwise, you might wind up damaging your credit simply because you didn't want to go to the gym!\nFrom getting a new cellular phone to not utilizing all three types of credit accounts, there are several lesser-known ways that many Americans are hurting their credit. If you are planning on securing a loan in the future, make sure you understand your credit report and what you can do to improve your score.\nFor more information on credit and loans, talk with a loaning company, such as Payday Express.", "version": "v0"}

Once the industry has had some time to ramp up production, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if Canadian legal weed companies were generating up to $5 billion in added annual sales by the early part of the next decade.\nWithin the U.S., despite the federal government holding firm on its belief that marijuana is a Schedule I drug, and therefore treated as an illicit substance, plenty of major advancements were made. Two new states (Utah and Missouri) voted to legalize medical pot, while Vermont and Michigan gave the green light to recreational weed. That\u2019s now 32 states that have approved medical cannabis in some capacity, 10 of which also allow adult consumption.\nWe also witnessed the Food and Drug Administration approve the very first cannabis-derived drug in June. Following a review by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), GW Pharmaceuticals\u2018 Epidiolex was given the least restrictive classification possible (Schedule V).\nThe $867 billion Farm Bill is designed to provide billions of dollars in aid to farmers who\u2019ve been hurt by the trade war between the U.S. and China. It notably legalizes the production and sales of industrial hemp and cannabidiol (CBD) derived from the hemp plant. CBD is the nonpsychoactive cannabinoid best known for its perceived medical benefits.\nHemp currently has a number of industrial uses in clothing, paper, paint, insulation, and animal feed. But it\u2019s the fact that the hemp plant has very little tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) \u2014 the cannabinoid responsible for getting a user high \u2014 and a high content of CBD that\u2019s so exciting. According to the Brightfield Group, the CBD market (this includes all types of CBD, not just from the hemp plant) is projected to grow by 147% per annum between 2018 and 2022, leading to a $22 billion market in a few short years. This, therefore, allows cannabis businesses to get their foot in the door nationally by producing and selling hemp-based CBD products.\nTo be clear, CBD from the cannabis plant is still classified as a regulated substance by the DEA. However, hemp is no longer to be associated with marijuana, and therefore hemp-based CBD isn\u2019t a controlled substance.\nThe legalization of hemp and hemp-based CBD is expected create substantial opportunities for a handful of publicly traded companies. Arguably at the top of that list is Canopy Growth(NYSE:CGC), the largest marijuana stock by market cap.\nAlthough Canopy Growth CEO Bruce Linton has been very clear that the company has no intention of entering the U.S. cannabis market until there are changes made at the federal level, the company is in the process of buying ebbu for about $315 million (425 million Canadian dollars). Colorado-based ebbu is a hemp-research company that possesses intellectual property (IP) designed to help hemp farmers lower their growing costs and improve yields. With a major barrier to growth now gone, it would be logical to assume that ebbu\u2019s IP could become a hot commodity in the States. Canopy Growth is already planning to use this IP to cut costs and improve yields for its hemp grow farm in Saskatchewan.\nThere\u2019s also the chance that Charlotte\u2019s Web Holdings (NASDAQOTH:CWBHF) receives a boost. Charlotte\u2019s Web currently sells CBD-based products (not limited to hemp-based CBD) in more than 3,000 retailers across the country. The legalization of hemp-based CBD should help normalize the product and could easily expand the company\u2019s hemp-based offerings into more retailers. Considering that Charlotte\u2019s Web is already profitable on a recurring basis, shareholders have to be pleased with the Farm Bill\u2019s passage into law.\nFlorida-based vertically integrated dispensary Liberty Health Sciences (NASDAQOTH:LHSIF)also plans to get in on the act. The company announced on Thursday, Dec. 20, that it plans to launch a line of hemp-derived CBD products, known as Zentient Labs. Liberty Health Sciences has about a dozen locations open or planned in Florida, with the expectation of 225,000 square feet of aggregate grow space by early 2019. Given that Florida could be one of America\u2019s billion-dollar medical cannabis markets, the move makes sense for Liberty Health.\nVertically integrated dispensaries have gone through the arduous process of being licensed for retail and cultivation in order to be the exclusive suppliers of cannabis-based products, including CBD products, in states where they are legal. With the passage of the Farm Bill, it now becomes possible for virtually any business to cultivate and distribute hemp-based CBD products, which could draw away both foot traffic and revenue for licensed dispensaries.\nTo be clear, vertically integrated dispensaries will still offer a broader line of products, including cannabis-derived CBD in select states. But their perceived exclusivity on CBD products has now been compromised, and it may show as an adverse impact in their sales or profit potential.\nIt\u2019ll certainly be interesting to see how the U.S. and Canadian cannabis industries respond to the Farm Bill becoming law.", "version": "v0"}

Because I work in a fascial field as a Rolfer\u00ae I've had a lot of people contact me for help with plantar fasciitis over the years and most of the time I have been able to easily help them. I've written about that approach here, and, in fact, when plantar fasciitis results from a short or gluey posterior chain of tissue (i.e. the calves, hamstrings, gluteals, and low back and spinal muscles), it does in fact respond very readily to to this approach. Tight fascia = loosen that fascia. Easy, right?\nFortunately there seems to be some divine order that says when a person (in this case, me) gets too assured of something (in this case via a formulaic way of thinking about the body), some wonderful opportunity to see the body freshly as the complex unified organism that it is presents itself.\nThe first time I had a plantar fasciitis client fail to respond was, as these things go, with a dear friend. And while I would love to pretend that I'm an enlightened being, when a friend in pain comes to me I now have my normal desire to help out layered with an egoic desire to be the one who \"fixes\" them. Ha ha ha! Silly mortal! You cannot fix people! Yes, this whole \"be the one who fixes people\" drive is usually a set up for a fall.\nThis was also the first time I had encountered plantar fasciitis as a result of a leg length discrepancy. Or at least it was the first time I became aware of that courtesy of the conversations that she and I, and the wonderful physical therapist who I had referred her to, had as things resolved. Since that time I have met with a handful of other people who were dealing with the same thing and so I wanted to write about it here to save some people the months and years of trying to get better to no avail.\nHere's the important detail: if someone is struggling with plantar fasciitis chronically and they are not responding to normal treatment (i.e. smart manual therapy and movement that addresses the fascial and functional movement problems), there is a good chance that they are dealing with a leg length problem, and until that gets resolved the pain is going exactly no where.\nSo first let's talk leg length discrepancies. They vary quite a lot from incredibly subtle to quite obvious. I write this because most people assume that if they have one longer leg that it would be glaringly obvious and they would be aware of it. However if it is the subtle variety (which also happens to be the most common variety) it usually goes unnoticed. Even teeny discrepancies can cause people a lot of grief.\nSemanitcs aside, here is why it is important to know if you are dealing with primarily a bone length difference or primarily an alignment/soft tissue issue* because depending on which flavor you have, your treatment will be quite different.\nA bone length difference happens when either your femur or your tibia is literally shorter on one side than another. This is the more rare scenario and will happen most commonly if you've had a break in one of those bones (particularly if that break happened when you were still growing), or if you've had a joint replacement since that requires actually removing and replacing part of both of those bones in the case of a knee replacement, and just the femur in the case of a hip replacement.\nThis is important to know because you cannot make your bones longer now. So while I'm not typically an orthotics kind of girl, if you have one leg that is longer than another due to a bone length discrepancy you are going to have to work with someone who can make a very thoughtful lift for you to wear. This will even out your leg length problem and start you on the road to healing.\nI say \"very thoughtful\" because you can't just go to the pharmacy and pick up something Dr. Scholl's produced for the masses. It needs to remedy the situation with precision and not be the cause of new trouble. Think of when you get dental work; If your dentist filled a cavity and left one tooth significantly longer than the other teeth- youch! It will hurt a lot when you try to bite down. And if one tooth is left shorter than the other teeth, your jaw strains to make your bite meet causing a different kind of discomfort that is more joint-centric (TMJ) and less tooth-centric. Your feet become how you \"bite down\" on the ground as you walk and stand, and a mismatched pair of legs will have repercussions into your ankles, knees, hips, pelvis, spine, and head. Not to mention that persnickety plantar fasciitis.\nEven if it is determined that you have a bone length difference, you have still spent a lot of years (usually) walking around on an uneven foundation, so you'll still need some thoughtful bodywork, but sadly thoughtful bodywork in the absence of a lift is not going to stick with you and the pain will return. So in the case of a bone length difference: lift first, bodywork next. And you may need to tweak the lift as your soft tissue compensations resolve.\nYou spent years competing in high jump and so always jumped off one leg, causing one psoas and quadratus lumborum to hike up.\nYou spent years carrying everything (kids, groceries, big purse, etc) on one side, causing one psoas and quadratus lumborum to hike up.\nYou had an abdominal surgery which caused some scar tissue internally causing one psoas and quadratus lumborum to hike up.\nYou have scoliosis which causes one psoas and quadratus lumborum to hike up.\nOk now I'm just being annoying. I have a rally cry here and in my practice which is, \"It's never just one thing!\" and that is true. And it is also never just two things like I oh so tidily made it in the bullet points above. It is always the synergy of how everything comes together and what compensatory patterns emerge to try and help you out. However, if you are dealing with a leg length discrepancy you can be sure that the psoas and quadratus lumborum are a big part of that dance. When they shorten on one side they have the effect not only of creating pelvic rotations and imbalances, but also of making the leg seem to tuck itself up into the pelvis more.\nSo if you have plantar fasciitis that has not resolved with manual therapy and you also have sacroiliac pain, low back pain, tight IT bands, piriformis syndrome, lateral knee pain, or gait problems (i.e. limping, or a strongly externally rotated leg), you may very well be dealing with an underlying leg length discrepancy which needs to be addressed in order for the pain to resolve. However, if the main \"buddies\" that come with your plantar fasciitis are tight hamstrings, calves, and gluteals, and you just plain have a tendency to overexert the hell out of yourself (hellooooo ultra marathoners!) you will likely do quite well with and get some long term resolution with manual and movement therapy alone.\nAnd if you think you might fit this description and are wondering which side you are longer on- the pain usually starts on the longer leg.\n* Yes, I got all uppity and italicized with the \"primarily\" because if you have a bone length difference you can be sure that you will also have an alignment issue. Also \"Soft Tissue Issue\" is a great name for a band and someone should steal that.", "version": "v0"}

Someone read my police autobiography where we look in some detail into the history of South Africa, trying to understand what went wrong and she contacted me with this question. \u201cWhat is the legacy of Apartheid?\u201d I tried to answer it in the books as the Mean Streets Books are in no way the usual \u201cI was there\u201d type of books or I hope not, they are supposed to be more serious than that. They are written for the reader to sit back and wonder, what if?\nThe problem with such a question is how far does a legacy like Apartheid stretch before you run out of excuses? We find this in law also. How far can you blame a fellow for an injury done to you. Let me explain, in law we have something called \u201ccausation,\u201d that is where you injure someone, and now you are held liable for that injury for the time being. There must be no intervening cause though, nothing else must have happened to worsen the injury, you cannot in all fairness be held liable for that further injury and is known as the \u201cbut for\u201d test. As it is with law, a practical example is much easier than the boring academic explanations you study at university. Let us say \u201cA\u201d injures \u201cB.\u201d As \u201cB\u201d is wheeled to an ambulance, she is struck by lightning (or dropped by the ambulance lads). She would not have been struck if she had not been injured in the first place. Clearly then, \u201cA\u201d caused \u201cB's\u201d injury on the \u2018but for\u2019 test. However, at law, the intervention of a supervening event renders the defendant not liable for the injury caused by the lightning or dropped by the ambulance lads. This is fair enough and also the time limits, usually, when a man dies of his injury one year after obtaining it, you would be hard pressed in court to be held responsible for murder instead of assault (hugely different punishment). So the line must be drawn somewhere when it comes to legacy, or being held responsible.\nNow the picture in South Africa is damn bleak to be honest. We have unemployment levels unheard of anywhere in the developing world with 70% of the matrics now leaving school, being unable to find employment. I put it differently in my books. I said in the worst time of the 1933 Great Depression, the USA had 18 to 24% unemployment. Today we have twice that and to some analysts 3 times that and all of us agree, we would love to have Great Depression levels of unemployment. Whatever the statistics, it is pathetic beyond belief. What comes from such unemployment? Crime, drugs, prostitution and hopelessness which you cannot comprehend unless you were there yourself. Even the Holy Bible advises poor people to drink wine to forget their sorrows (said tongue-in-cheek). What else is happening? People have left and are leaving and no, unless utter morons and unable to make it elsewhere, seldom come back and yet, some of the turd brigade (they talk what they float in) will say \u201cgood riddance.\u201d Problem is, those leaving, are the cream of society. The educated ones, our doctors, engineers, nurses, teachers, academics (no lawyers, they are not the cream of society in any sense of the word). It is sad when you lose such talented people and another myth - most are non-political - they are not all racists and they are not all right wing whiners although you get them too. Most leave because they see no future here and rightly so. I am also willing to bet, that there are hundreds of thousands more wanting to leave if only they could. What does this tell me? Big problems, they see no future in South Africa and they are from all races, not just whites.\nSpeaking about races, that is another legacy which I find irksome. As much as Apartheid was a failed racial experiment, what is happening now is the same. When you watch a soapy on television (thank God I don\u2019t) or talk to producers (I do) then you find out everything there is according to race \u2013 so many whites, so many Indians, so many coloureds and so many black actors. Stereotyping taken to the extremes and it is killing the effectiveness of such programs being so unreal it is scary. In fact, it is thinly disguised social engineering and we saw it in the US and other places also. Have you ever noticed something about the Bill Cosby programs? Besides the anti-Apartheid sticker on the fridge? Yes, successful, happily married, ex-serviceman, educated professional man being portrayed and why not, we love success stories and I was a big Cosby Show fan then. These things are not by chance, it is by design. The same is happening with advertisements in South Africa, never just white or just black, always a nice mixture betraying a utopia which does not exist in real life, so it is all rubbish and I pray more would wake up and see it. Race should not play a role in your thinking or marketing, but it does, a very large role.\nSo what else do we have in the Apartheid Legacy? We saw the unemployment, the rise in crime, the depressing emigration of our social elite, the social engineering in every television show, media and printed media (thank God for self-publishing) and what else? Well, we got a good Bill of Human Rights which is working, I would shudder if it was not there and it is for you to invoke it. See this fellow who recently laid criminal charges against the social media racists? Yes, the law is neutral, you abuse it for your purposes or it is useless to you. The law cannot help you unless you invoke it, always remember that. Defend your rights. On the positive side, we don\u2019t have limpet mines exploding all over the place but then we have riots, violent ones. We have a perceived pathetic police and army, endemic corruption and a complete lack of hope for the future. That is probably the legacy which the ANC will one day have to answer for, the way they managed to get the hope of the 1990s destroyed utterly. You can blame Apartheid for everything, rightly so up to a point, but not for the loss of hope I see around me. That was the intervening cause and the causes were and are numerous. I wonder, how far down can we go before we wake up.", "version": "v0"}

I never wear anything less than a 30 either as I have such sensitive and delicate skin I don\u2019t want to burn.\nThis shower gel smells so so good and is so refreshing. I prefer to use shower gels, even in the bath rather than a bar of soap. This one leaves you feeling invigorated and clean and you don\u2019t need to use much. I have to hide it away so Nick won\u2019t use it all up!\nI really like the simply packaging for all of the products. I love how they use multicolours on the plain white background and the shapes they use are associated with the products. The hand cream has hands on, the sun cream has suns on etc.\nI worked with this brand too, I love them.\nI\u2019m always on the lookout for good products like these \u2013 I will definitely be looking for these in the shops. I love their packaging!", "version": "v0"}

Behind it is a core fear that no one will be there. My husband, older by a few years, statistically is unlikely to live beyond me \u2013 perish the thought. My family is comprised of stepchildren who were adults when I came into their lives and who are very much involved in their own lives. My fear tells me they won\u2019t step up to care for me.\nCertainly I have a circle of friends, many friends of varying ages, but who will be there at a time of need? Who will still be close at that precise point in the arc of my life? Who will be alive, willing, and still have the faculties to be my health advocate? With no clear answers, fear beats a worn path through my mind. I\u2019m supposed to plan, but don\u2019t even have a flashlight to guide my steps.\nFor years, I\u2019ve been trying to live in the present moment. Plan for the future, yes, but live in the now. The practice has been invaluable in bringing joy to the present moment, in allowing me to really live my life with a capital L. And yes, I will keep living in the moment, but prudence suggests that I acknowledge the possibility that the people I\u2019ve already designated as my advocates will not be available or able to attend to the responsibilities they\u2019ve graciously accepted.\nSince I was asked to write this blog, I\u2019ve had conversations with some of my younger friends and they\u2019ve volunteered to be my \u201cfamily\u201d when decisions need to be honored. They\u2019ve also been grateful that I\u2019ve been explicit in identifying what I do and do not want to occur when I\u2019m in the last stages of my life. While I hate having the conversations and feel absolutely as if I\u2019m the only person who doesn\u2019t have a ready-made family to gather and care at the end of my life, I know I\u2019m not alone.\nStatistics show parents who are counting on their children to care for them, may be pinning their future on a false hope. Even if their children care for them deeply, in our mobile society many adult children live thousands of miles from their parents and don\u2019t have the time or knowledge to make intelligent decisions. Many adult children are not involved in their parents\u2019 lives.\nCaregivers and professionals state that the very best thing anyone can do, whether you have children or not, is to get your own house in order. Make your decisions, communicate those decisions to your health care providers, your lawyers, accountants and friends. I\u2019ve done those things and am now working on de-cluttering my home and making sure that I am as prepared as I can be, so that those who do rally to my side have fewer decisions to make and angst to go through.\nSuccessful entrepreneur and former Houston radio personality, Dayna Steele wrote a caregiver\u2019s guide Surviving Alzheimer\u2019s with Friends, Facebook, and a Really Big Glass of Wine after becoming a caregiver to her mother, Fran Nicholson. With humor and emotions that resonate, Steele chronicles their daily journey to its inevitable end. She also shares important observations and resources to anyone faced with caring for a loved one struck with Alzheimer\u2019s. If you are facing this situation, Dayna is a voice you need to hear and this is a book you need to read.\nOur book, Senior Wonders: People Who Achieved Their Dreams After Age 60 profiles 23 individuals and two groups who not only survived into old age, but achieved their greatest successes. As we wrote our book, we looked for emerging themes. Were there any commonalities among these people? Although their accomplishments were in a variety of fields (arts, sciences, social causes, entertainment, etc.), several themes became apparent. We think of them as the 3 P\u2019s: Passion, Perspective on Life, and Persistence.\nPassion, by definition, is any compelling emotion or feeling. These individuals either had a strong belief in what they were doing, or in the case of those with an artistic bent, they couldn\u2019t help creating, whether it was writing, painting, or acting.\nMany of the seniors in our book faced daunting obstacles and accomplished their goals by sheer will and determination; they did not give up.\nPerspective on life emerged as a theme when we noticed that several of our seniors commented that they couldn\u2019t have achieved their success at an earlier age. Having lived a long life enabled them to learn from failures and successes, establish a clear focus, and develop a unique perspective.\nOur last P is Persistence. This theme became apparent when we observed that many of our seniors faced daunting obstacles and accomplished their goals by sheer will and determination; they did not give up.\nAuthor Harry Bernstein and humanitarian Clara McBride Hale are two who exemplify these themes.\nFor those who are traveling rather than retiring overseas, it\u2019s best to be prepared. If you have a medical condition and run out of your prescription, will a foreign pharmacy be able to fill an American prescription? If you have an accident and need to see a doctor or go to the hospital, do you know how your insurance will cover that?\nTravel with your daily medications, not in the pharmacy container, but in a day-to-day container. Take enough for a few days in your carry-on luggage and put the remainder in your suitcase.\nTake a list of all your medications. Include the dosage, when you take it and for what condition. Include over-the-counter drugs and any herbal supplements.\nMake a comprehensive list of procedures and/or surgeries that you have had.\nList your allergies and reactions. If you require a procedure that uses an intravenous dye, shellfish is an important allergy to note.\nTell your medical insurance carrier that you are going out of the country. They will give you specific instructions in case something happens, along with an international phone number to call. Keep this information close at hand with your medical lists/records.\nWrite down phone numbers for physicians and emergency contacts.\nFile a HIPAA release form with a family member or friend, so if you become seriously ill while traveling, they would be able to obtain information or act on your behalf.\nThese suggestions are a proactive approach to travel, and if something unexpected happens, they become vital.\nMedicAlert Foundation and the Alzheimer\u2019s Association have partnered to provide protection and a national emergency response service for individuals living with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related dementia who wander or have a medical emergency. The Safe Return program activates a community support network when a person with dementia is reported lost or is found in the community. The network, including local Alzheimer Association chapters and law enforcement agencies, work to help reunite the person who wandered with the caregiver or family.\nMedicalert.org will provide the resources you need to help get your family member safely returned. If you are caring for a person with dementia, there is a 60% chance that your loved one will wander and become lost, please increase the odds that they are found and returned safely by using the service provided by Medicalert.org (or call 1-800-432-5878).", "version": "v0"}

Thanks for the help!\nFirst off, have a film to present do not try to pass off impromptu shadow puppetry as your film. Secondly, at the really important or emotional points shout ,\"Bingo! Now that's what I'm talking about!\" This lets others know when the important parts are coming. Finally when the movie ends hand out hundred dollar bills and when placing then surreptitiously in their hands lean in and say \"The boss thinks that this film should be the tops, Capeesh!\"\nHaha, this comment started out somewhat helpful.\nIf you have time, sit a teddy bear on a chair.

Explain what they're going to see, let them watch it, then go through again, explaining what they've just seen, and ask for questions/comments.\nGood suggestion. I've already shown it to my sister and friend which helped a lot.\nDunno how helpful this is, but maybe make sure you're holding something like a pen when presenting it, just so that you have something to do absentmindedly with your hands.\nYeah that's a better idea than biting my nails which is what I usually do.\nHey Internetcoitus!

Of course the financial reasons are apparent, taking this decision usually only comes as a result of existing sales or a strong presence. But selling your products, services, or business abroad is one thing, setting up and having boots on the ground is entirely another. There\u2019s a lot to consider beyond business, families, languages, partnerships, sales, and marketing.\nHere is some of our advice based on the clients we\u2019ve helped.\nDon\u2019t expect your existing business model to remain the same. Be open to change and absolutely avoid the thinking that what works at home will work for your business abroad. Embracing change as the business climate is better understood in the target market can lead to better profits at home. There are challenges faced, such as access to mobile technology, that will mean new ideas will have to be discussed.\nBut external, client facing localization is just as important. To support your employees, they will need every tool at their disposal if they are going to make a success of an international project. This can be from the social networks used in the target country, (WeChat in China, for example) to the currency symbols used on your pricing pages.\nThe biggest barrier for a business to overcome is communication. Cultural differences and consumer behaviour make frustrating markets even for established businesses. To get your foot in the door, language and communication is the pillar of it all.\nThink you\u2019ll beat out the incumbents on service quality? If you sell on price, what\u2019s the point of the project? Without the ability to communicate with potential partners and clients, without language you will not earn trust. Start thinking locally.\nMany people quickly jump to technology, for obvious reasons due to its immediate penetration into markets where you may not eve have a local presence. But the key technology that will define the success of your project will probably be the humble telephone.\nIt\u2019s easy to look at global megaliths such as AirBnB and believe that the internet will bring in the profits to your business model. You remember how your business started, so don\u2019t expect anything different abroad. Get the best salesperson in your company to vet and hire a local rep and get them on the phone.\nLarger businesses acquire there smaller counterparts only for the door-to-door sales that those companies have sweated through to grow their businesses in the first place. Having a hunter, that dedicated salesperson to chase down leads, create new contacts, and hit the phones to bring in early adopters is essential, forget inbound, don\u2019t rely on web forms, reach out.\nThe term barrier to entry is widely used on this topic. It plays on the challenges; incumbent businesses, culture, competition, behaviour. But there is a sliding scale here. Lower barriers to entry imply greater challenges and greater opportunity. If there is no barrier to entry, you could assume there is a reason. High barriers to entry imply the market is alive, business are trading, and the competition is high, just like in your domestic markets, it shows that cash is flowing. Look at the competition, if it\u2019s not there, think long before you decide to enter the market.\nGlobal and local go hand in hand.\nGroupon, though an international powerhouse, relies heavily on local business. This means presence is required to make connections in local markets, and higher investment and setup costs. Behind the snazzy apps and fast webpages, there is a huge underbelly of more traditional operations that bring value to local customers. We\u2019re reiterating the need for local presence but this is fundamental to business.\nBEPS (profit shifting) and GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) are under scrutiny. As tax authorities slowly turn the screw on the tax structures of multinational businesses, startups are forced to follow suit. For all of the right reasons, having a local tax professional to handle duties in each location of your international operations is insurance against hefty fines.\nIf there\u2019s one takeaway from this article. It\u2019s that you shouldn\u2019t rely heavily on your existing team to make your business successful abroad. It puts pressure on business at home, and it\u2019s less likely to make an impact on your target destination.", "version": "v0"}

Nothing can beat the romance of a Valentine's Day nuptials or the fun of a New Year's Eve ceremony. But this year, couples have a once-in-alifetime opportunity to tie the knot on a unique day-July 7, 2007, or 7/7/7.\nWhether brides and grooms are choosing the date for luck or the ease of remembering their anniversary, July 7, which happens to be a Saturday, is turning out to be one of the most popular days this year to get married, according to local event planners and wedding vendors.\n\"We've had so many inquiries for that day,\" said Ilene McHone, owner of Carmelbased Classic Cakes. \"For a while, we were wondering why everybody was calling for that date.\"\nMcHone braces for a June rush every year, then normally takes a vacation in early July with her husband to celebrate their own wedding anniversary. This year, she said, \"we may have to change our vacation plans.\"\nSo far, no one ordering a cake for a July 7 wedding has requested a \"lucky sevens\" theme, but McHone has heard a few jokes about grooms being able to remember their anniversary.\nCakes, photographers and florists may be more difficult to come by for anyone still in the planning stages of a 7/7/07 wedding.\n\"Choices might be limited for vendor selection,\" said Tonya Shadoan, owner of Circle City Planners, who noted that almost every reception venue in the city is already booked for July 7.\nShadoan started working with a couple who wanted to pin down July 7 a year ago, allowing them to take their pick of venues and vendors.\n\"They decided this was the perfect day to get married, so they hired me and we picked those vendors right away,\" she said.\nHer clients, however, didn't choose the day for luck or convenience, but decided to have a little fun with the numbers.\n\"They realized their parents got married on 6-6 and a sister got married on 8-8, and [the bride] was born in 1977 and weighed 7 pounds 7 ounces,\" Shadoan said.\nNow that many other couples have jumped on the 7-7-7 bandwagon, Shadoan said it's \"kind of annoying\" for her clients, but they are reassured to know they have a head start on their planning. \"They kind of laugh at the people who just got engaged and say they are going to get married on 7-7-7,\" she said.\nFortunately for those tying the knot that day, vendors and reception sites aren't taking advantage of the greater demand by commanding higher rates.\n\"It doesn't translate to higher prices, and facilities aren't raising their minimums,\" Shadoan said.\nAnother reason July 7 is turning out to be a favorite date is its proximity to the July 4 holiday.\n\"Holiday weekends in general are always popular,\" said Leslie Swathwood, a Carmel-based wedding planner with Elegant Events and publisher of the \"Perfect Wedding Guide\" publication.\n\"I encourage people to have their wedding over a holiday weekend,\" Shadoan added. \"It gives guests the opportunity to travel here and enjoy our city.\"\nOf the 1,100 brides who attended the guide's January bridal show at the Scottish Rite Cathedral, 48 were planning a July 7, 2007, wedding, Swathwood's database shows.\n\"People think it's a cool anniversary to have and they can do cute stuff related to favors,\" she said. \"One of the biggest trends in weddings is personalization and customization. Brides want to have something special and unique for their circle of friends and family.\"\nPlaying with numbers may be one way to put a unique stamp on a wedding. Planners said it's increasingly common for couples to choose their wedding date based on the appeal of the numbers involved-or to steer clear of a particular day that doesn't sound right.\n\"I did have a couple a few years ago that was very into numerology and they picked their wedding day based around what these numbers meant for wealth and health,\" said Deanna Boyce, owner of Indianapolis-based Eventfull Planning LLC. \"But most people pick dates based on how much time they have to plan the date.\"\nShadoan worked with a couple who was bound and determined to get married on a particular date, even though it was a Wednesday.\n\"I've yet to do another Wednesday night wedding,\" she said.\nOn the flip side, couples view some dates as minefields, as many expectant mothers did around June 6, 2006. Fewer weddings are held on the 13th of any month, and when Sept. 11 falls on a Saturday, as it did in 2004, there's a noticeable dip, according to McHone.\nOverall, however, September and October are gaining ground as popular months to get married and may someday surpass May and June as the traditional wedding season, Swathwood said.", "version": "v0"}

There is something very exciting about the thought of bringing home a fluffy and snuggly new pup. And while the Ottawa Humane Society will always extol the virtues of adult dogs, adopting a puppy may be the best decision for some.\nPuppies can certainly bring joy to our lives, but the decision to get a puppy is a big one, and should be carefully considered. For most pet owners, the middle-of-the-night wake-ups, house-training accidents and chewing mishaps are completely worth it, as long as the entire family is ready for the commitment and is eager to make sure that the puppy is properly socialized and that consistent training begins at a young age.\nIn any of the above scenarios, the most important thing is to make sure you\u2019re acquiring your puppy from a reputable source. But what does that mean?\nWhile there are many great small rescues out there, there are also too many which, despite best intentions have become overwhelmed with the care needs of the animals they take in and are operating well outside of their capacity for care. With minimal resources and multiple limitations, things quickly spiral out of control. They are not able to properly care for their animals, and as a result the animals suffer. Many people \u201crescue\u201d animals from these situations\u2014which just ends up perpetuating the problem.\nSimilarly, not all breeders are the same. While there are some very responsible breeders out there, unfortunately, there are also many unethical breeders with substandard practices who value profit over welfare. Poor breeding practices, from breeding too often to breeding the wrong dogs, results in dogs with chronic and sometimes fatal health conditions, and poor animal welfare means many breeding animals are living in squalid conditions. Many unethical breeders hide behind the internet, ensuring that unsuspecting buyers don\u2019t witness the horrendous living conditions of the dogs in their care.\nSo how do you know what to look for? We recommend that you start by taking a look at Humane Canada\u2019s detailed description of an ethical breeder, as well as their list of essential questions to ask any breeder you might be considering.\nAs a responsible pet owner to-be, you\u2019ve carefully considered a lot of factors before making the decision to get a puppy. Don\u2019t stop there. Do your research. If you uncover inhumane practices, don\u2019t be tempted purchase or adopt that puppy to save it from a bad situation. This only feeds into the problem and allows those organizations or businesses to continue operating. You can help those animals best by reporting any inhumane situation to the authorities.\nUltimately, you can help prevent the suffering of countless more animals by taking the time to make sure that you are getting your new puppy from a reputable and ethical source.\nNext PostMight saving dogs in Korea kill yours?\nPrevious PostWho are the Heroes that Save Lives?", "version": "v0"}

They travelled there at their own expense in February 2018 for treatment for lymphoedema.\nThinking of going to Wittlinger Lymphoedema Clinic for Treatment?\nThis is the experience I had of a one-week trip to Wittlinger with my mother, Gay, who developed lymphoedema in both legs after cancer treatment. We did a \u2018taster week\u2019.\nShould I go to Wittlinger?\nIf you have lymphoedema and you can afford it, or can find a way to have it paid for, absolutely yes. We were extremely impressed and mum saw tangible improvements in her measurements in just a week. What\u2019s more, mum found it a huge learning experience and was able to get a lot of questions answered and useful tips on dealing with lymphoedema.\nThe schedule is different every day and you get your schedule for the next day at dinner. On average, we had our first half-hour exercise class at 7am. Then we would usually have breakfast and maybe a bit of a break before the first MLD session which might be at 10am for an hour. What we hadn\u2019t anticipated was that mum would have both of her legs bandaged 24-7 from her first MLD session on Monday. So we had to set aside a half-hour before each MLD session to remove and roll-up her bandages so that they could be reapplied by the therapist at the end of the session.\nAfter the MLD, there might be a break and we would usually do a walk into Walchsee or go for a coffee. Lunch would be from 12 and sometime in the afternoon mum would have her second MLD session (we paid \u20ac90 per day so that she could get a second session every day). Before or after that session we would do a longer walk and/or another coffee, and of course take off the bandages. On two days there were optional extra oedema exercise classes which we did in the afternoon \u2013 there are optional activities every day so you just see how it works with the rest of your schedule and what you\u2019re interested in. The second mandatory exercise class of the day was at 5pm for a half hour. Dinner was at 6 and the evenings were free. We generally didn\u2019t do much in the evenings. Sometimes people had a glass of wine at the bar and you could certainly go into the village if you were so inclined. But we generally flopped and got ready for the next day!\nWhat\u2019s so great about Wittlinger?\nThe clinical director, Dr Christine Heim, has been at Wittlinger specialising in lymphoedema for 18 years. One of mum\u2019s therapists, Barbara, has been doing MLD there for the same amount of time. They treat lymphoedema (and lipoedema) 24-7. There is no substitute for this kind of experience. They have seen it all!\nIt\u2019s not just MLD, doctor visits and 24-7 bandaging. There are also the two mandatory exercise classes a day and additional voluntary classes like aquarobics or yoga. The food is designed to help with weight loss which they encourage if you need it. For their average patient who comes for three weeks, there seem to be other services like a dietician and psychologist visits. As we were on the taster week, we didn\u2019t experience these.\nIt\u2019s a really nice place and doesn\u2019t feel clinical, despite most people going around in bandages on their arms or legs! There\u2019s a nice bar in the lobby, swimming pool etc. The rooms are excellent and have balconies. Ours had a great view of the beautiful snowy valley.\nThere was really nothing that was too much trouble to the staff. Everybody was focused on patient care. They described it as a team effort \u2013 you and they worked together to improve your condition.\nThe food was all healthy and (for a one-week stay at least) it was varied. There was always a vegetarian option in every meal. Mum\u2019s situation is tricky as she is a vegan who eats fish, which we had told them in advance, but in fairness is a bit more difficult to deal with! Initially this was a bit of an issue (although we had brought food from home so it was OK) but once the kitchen staff realised, they did their best to give her extra fish, beans and soya milk and yoghurt. We were able to buy canned fish easily at the local Spar so it was fine. But for most people, the food will be grand! It might not set your world on fire but it\u2019s nice enough and there\u2019s a good bit of choice.\nWalchsee is stunningly beautiful and we did lots of walks in the snow, including around the lake. There was sledding too but we didn\u2019t find the time! There are plenty of shops with all necessities (the local Spar is a 10-15 minute walk and much more like a supermarket than in Ireland). There is an organic cheese factory and shop right next to the clinic and shops with gifts. There are also really nice cafes and (presumably) really nice restaurants although we had all our meals at the Wittlinger. You could cross-country ski if you had your own gear and I\u2019m almost positive you could rent equipment but since I\u2019d never skied, I would have had to go to the neighbouring Kossen to learn and I never found the time. Downhill skiing was also available nearby. In the summer there are apparently a series of different activities like hiking and cycling.\nThere\u2019s no getting around it, unless you get approved on the HSE\u2019s Treatment Abroad Scheme, or find a miracle insurance company (please tell us if you do! We already got turned down flat by VHI!), you\u2019ll have to pay privately. The \u2018taster week\u2019 that we went on is the best deal: \u20ac820 all inclusive (this includes one MLD session per day, if you want an extra session, it will cost \u20ac90 per session). For an accompanying person it costs \u20ac60 per day full board including use of all facilities which I thought was excellent value (this includes sauna/steam-room and jacuzzi which the patients are not advised to use so accompaniers have full access!). Beyond the \u2018taster week\u2019 it is more expensive but you have to ask for an individual quote \u2013 we were told to expect at least \u20ac1,000 a week). The bandages that they provided (and that you take home) cost \u20ac160 \u2013 but that\u2019s for two legs, so for many people it would be less than that (and you can bring your own bandages if you want).\nMost people speak German and the classes are held in German. They can hardly be blamed for this since the clinic is in Austria! The staff largely can speak English. Exercise classes in German were easy to follow, and we had no communication problems. But as far as socialising was concerned, that was more tricky. There weren\u2019t too many patients during our week who were comfortable speaking English \u2013 most were Austrian or German. There were also a couple of Italians and us. Other weeks might be different as there are patients from US, Canada and Australia at times. We were extremely lucky to be placed at a meal table (you keep the same meal table for the whole week) with a wonderful Austrian woman called Margarete who had good enough English and who had been to Wittlinger for over ten years. She could not have been more helpful to us as we learnt the ropes. The only activities we couldn\u2019t really do because of language were the optional relaxation or meditation classes as we didn\u2019t think listening to German would be that relaxing! The only way you might avoid this, if you had flexibility on your dates, would be to ask the administrator (Rosi was our contact) if there are English-speakers booked for that week.\nWhat is there to do for an accompanying person?\nLoads. There are lots of useful things to do for the patient like helping to take off bandages and running errands here and there. I also did all the exercise classes with mum which I was welcome to do and I found them very good. I also worked a lot on my laptop (I paid \u20ac12 for the week for internet on all the devices in our room). This was very possible since evenings were free after around 6:30/7, and you get an hour off whenever the patient is at MLD and lots of small gaps in between. I also went for runs, used the gym (it\u2019s not amazing but decent enough) and used the pool facilities. And as mentioned cross-country skiing could be an option.\nWhat did we learn that wasn\u2019t on the website?\nThis is a random collection! The welcome book they give you in the room is also very helpful for info.\nThanks to Karina we knew to fly direct to Munich and then got a shared taxi from Four Seasons Travel tirol-taxi.at which took about 1 hour 15 each way and was very good. It\u2019s probably not the cheapest option (\u20ac200 return for the two of us) but the train option didn\u2019t seem too convenient.\nTaking bandages off two legs twice a day took an hour per day, and that was both of us working together. So that is one of the pluses of having an accompanying person. Having said that if you have lymphoedema in only one arm, for example, this would be a lot easier and quicker.\nThere\u2019s a fridge in your room!\nThere are washing machines, a dryer and irons in the basement. You can buy tokens at reception and get a hold of some washing powder (or bring it with you).\nThere are well-stocked shops nearby.\nThey sell very cool Velcro sandals for \u20ac54 that work well when legs are bandaged. Alternatively, bring your own larger, wider shoes from home if your legs are to be bandaged.\nEnglish channels are available on the televisions in the rooms, just keep looking (we didn\u2019t find them until Thursday when Margarete told us!).\nThere are moneyboxes at the bar to give tips to the kitchen and wait staff.\nThere are beauty treatments available but everybody books manicures and pedicures months in advance for the last day!\nHow do I find out more about Wittlinger Clinic?\nThe website is very good. Also feel free to contact us through Lymphoedema Ireland if you have any questions.", "version": "v0"}

Growing up as the middle child of the family I never understood my parents love and care for us. My aunt, known as one of the \"funniest\" members of the family joked with me over the years asking, what special reason I had to be loved by my parents. Since my sister was the first born, and my brother was the \"baby\" and \"the son\", nothing was left for me. She did not understand the deep impact of her jokes on me and I never understood why I wasn't loved. Nobody knew that I needed the truth explained to me; that I needed to know that my parents loved me just because I was their daughter. For years I felt rejected and unloved. As time went on, the only purpose of my life became trying to earn my parents' love.\nWhen I was five years old my parents couldn't find a nanny to take care of me while they were at work. My mother, who was an elementary school teacher, started to take me to the school where she taught leaving me in one of the first grade classes. After this my days were pretty routine. I was in class during the day, and at home I played with my books. I didn't know how to read yet, but I would look at the letters and make up stories based on how they were shaped. One day when I was looking at my books, all of a sudden the letters made words rather than pictures, the words made sentences, and I no longer needed to make up stories - I could read them. My parents rejoiced when they discovered that I learned to read \"all by myself\".\nNear the end of the school year my mom's school was going through the yearly teachers' evaluation. One day the principal of the school came to my class with an Evaluator. I was the only one in the class who could answer their questions. When my parents heard about this they were surprised and quite pleased with me. So, along with everything else I learned in first grade, I learned that the easiest way to earn my parents' \"love\" was to be successful at school.\nThis discovery changed my life dramatically. From that day I became very competitive, doing better was my only desire - better than my classmates, better than my siblings, and even better than myself. As a result, I became one of the best students in my school. My dad loved science and planted that love in me at a very early age. He seemed to accept me regardless of my performance, but I felt like my mom's love was dependent on my achievements. Thus, my father became a good friend but I isolated myself from my mother.\nWhen I was getting ready for the college entrance exams, my big dream was to get into a biology department. I found I was fascinated with nature, and this, together with the love of science that I had learned from my father, fueled my desire to study biology. When the results of the exam were posted, I found out that I was qualified to be in the Biology department, my third choice. Upon my father's request my first two choices had been the top medical schools of Turkey. I was so excited and happy. I could hardly wait to give the good news to my parents.\nHowever a big disappointment was in store for me. The idea of having a daughter in medical school was so appealing to them that the news that I had \"only\" qualified for biology was a letdown. Their disappointment showed me that I had failed, first in my studies, and then in not being able to earn their \"love\". I had worked so hard for such a bitter ending. So when I started college my heart felt sour within me.\nBut when I began college things within me started to change. I was spending the majority of my time immersed in my biology books, and was awed by the complexities and perfection of life on a biological scale. I realized that I loved learning purely for learning's sake and not in order to gain my parents' approval. I was growing up! So my bitter feelings shortly were crowded out by overwhelming enthusiasm.\nAnother change that started to occur in me was regarding religious belief. I had grown up in a secular household. Although my family was not religious, we observed all the usual traditions. However, we did not observe the prayer rituals, nor did we fast. During summer vacations my friends went to the mosque to learn Namaz, the Islamic prayer ritual, and to learn to recite the Qur'an. But in our home, we didn't even mention these things. Growing up, I had believed that the universe was formed as a result of the \"Big-Bang\" and that life was formed through a series of random events. What I believed about God was quite different from my friends' beliefs, too. For me God was created by men. Evolutionary speaking, in all primate societies there had been a need for a strong, unquestioned leader. However, as humans developed the abilities to live outside social groupings, the need for an unquestioned leader disappeared. Because the instinct to believe and obey something unquestionable is still strong, man created God. I was very content with this belief. In truth, I was even proud of my unusual beliefs.\nHowever, my first year in college, I felt that everything I believed was disintegrating in my hands. When I started to take classes like Zoology, Botany, Molecular Biology, Chemistry, and Cytology, I started to realize that life was too perfect to be the product of random events. One day I remember looking through a microscope and watching this little cell with awe, thinking there must be a God, the Creator of this life!\nI became very confused. I didn't know what to do. One day - a little embarrassed - I went to talk to my father and told him what I thought. He listened to me carefully, without interrupting, as was his habit, and then answered me with a smile; \"I don't want you to be ashamed of your thoughts. If you believe there is a God, go search, and you shall find\". Two years of studying and practicing Islam started at this time period.\nMy interest in Islam pleased my mother's mother the most. She immediately got a Qur'an and books on Islam for me. She brought some Zamzam water, had me drink it, repent of my sins, make a promise to stay away from sin, and recite the Shahada.\nInitially, I didn't care much about what Islam and Qur'an was all about. All I wanted to know was God. I learned the basics: memorized suras, learned wudu and prayer, read the Qur'an every Thursday night, fasted during Ramadan.\nI studied hard, practiced hard, but only thing that happened in my life was following a different set of rules now. I did not know God anymore than I did the day I told my dad I thought there was a God. I might have become a nicer person at the time, but it was all in my power and initiative. Deep inside me I knew I was no different. On the top of these what I learned from my Islamic books and mentors did not help either. At the end of two years I was quite disappointed - even hurt - by my findings and experiences. After days and nights of struggling with myself, and feeling ashamed that I was wrong, I went to my father and told him that I was not able to find my God. I was heart broken.\nThe summer of that year, I started to work as a reader at the School for the Blind. There, I met with a lady who was associated with a Hindu group. I was quite excited to hear about this group, and I started to go to their meetings with her. All summer long, I studied with them the essentials of Hinduism - as well as of Buddhism. Because Islam had failed me, I was a lot more reserved about taking a step of faith in either of these. One of the members of this group was also interested in the old Turkic religions, and he helped me to understand the basics of those religions. At the end of the summer, the conclusion of my search was quite clear. All these religions were created by men to bring regulation to society. There was no God. I was stuck with Atheism.\nThen followed a time of confusion and bewilderment. All joy and peace left my heart. I had lost hope - hope for the future, hope for finding God, or that there was anything greater than human existence. So, I went back to doing what I knew best, being an excellent student. I thought that I could find satisfaction in myself.\nBut it didn't work. The inner restlessness that I had grew stronger every day, and I couldn't live with myself anymore. So, I tried other things. You know what a party animal is, right? Well, that was me. Drinking, smoking, rebelling - everything you can imagine! Yet, these things didn't satisfy me. More and more, I knew that I had no peace in my heart. I longed to change--but I didn't know how.\nIn this sorry state, I finished university. On graduation day, as I was walking downtown, I started to think about my future. I knew that I had a long life ahead of me, but I didn't know what I would do with it. Frustrated, I walked into a store and stood in front of a mirror. As I looked at myself, I realized that I didn't like what I saw. Tears welled up as I considered who I was. This was a turning point for me. I decided that I was going to change my life and be a different person - have a good job, a good career, a good family, and a good income. I looked around at all the ordinary people in the world, reflecting that their lives were no different than mine but that they seemed happy. I decided to try being an ordinary person. So, I quit smoking, drinking, and hanging around those of my \"friends\" who had that kind of lifestyle. I got my first job, a very good-paying job, in fact. At the same time, I went back to school and earned my Master's degree, and then started to work on my Ph.D. But even all these things didn't satisfy me. In my heart, I fought with myself day and night. In Jeremiah 2:13, God says, \"My people have committed two sins: They have forsaken me, the spring of living water, and have dug their own cisterns, broken cisterns that cannot hold water\". My heart was a broken cistern, and I tried to fill it myself. As Islam had failed me, I was failing myself.\nIn September 1992, I was nearing the end of my Ph.D. program when one of my professors in the department told me about a scholarship to go overseas to study for a different Ph.D. First, I thought, \"No, I'm about to finish one; why bother starting all over again?\" But it took me only half an hour to decide, \"Yes, I would like to try\". I got the scholarship and quit my Ph.D. program. Leaving everything behind, I packed my whole life into two suitcases and came to the United States to start all over again. I had a feeling that it was going to be different there.\nIt was different in the U.S., and I didn't like it. Honestly, I hated it with a passion. I didn't know any English, I didn't know the culture, and I didn't know anybody there. Everything was so strange to me. I asked myself again and again, \"I had everything I needed back home, so why did I come here?\" Of course, I didn't know the answer, and I didn't even know if there was an answer. But I didn't go home. I studied English, tried to understand American culture, and made some friends in the dormitory. It so happens they were all born-again Christians who talked about their faith with me. They were all very nice, helpful, smart, religious ... and very brainwashed! I didn't believe that one could be smart and religious at the same time. Since they had helped me to adjust to my new life in the U.S., I decided I could help them to see that they were all deluded.\nIf you are going to fight against something, you need to know it well, so I asked them to give me a Bible. Knowing that I would find contradictions and inconsistencies, I started to read it. However - and there's really no other way to describe it - a miracle happened! Each day, the words brought more and more peace to my heart and hope for my life. Also, Christianity deeply impressed me because of its differences from the other religions that I had studied. It was unique in a lot of ways, but four of them were particularly important to me.\nFirst, Jesus was the only one who claimed to be the only way to God. What confidence that gave me! This was no vague instruction on how to reach God. This was a certain path. Jesus says, \"No one comes to the Father except through me\".\nSecond, people's sins could be forgiven without the need for good deeds to cancel them out. In every other religion, one has to be punished for the sins one has committed, but in Christianity one's sins can be forgiven. Having lived in sin as long as I had, I knew that I could never finish paying the penalty for them. I needed forgiveness. Human beings, in their weakness, don't know the real meaning of forgiveness, I think. This generous forgiveness can only come from God.\nThird, one doesn't have to work for one's salvation. Salvation is by the grace of God. My whole life, I had tried to earn the peace and hope that I longed for but saw that I didn't have. Therefore, it was very meaningful to see that God was reaching out to me instead of my trying to reach Him.\nFourth and last, God loved me as I was. I didn't have to do anything to earn His love. This was quite new to me. I discovered that I was important to God just because I existed. It seemed to me that this truth was different from other religions.\nI became convinced that Christianity was not a man-made religion. So, I continued to study the Bible, more and more enthusiastically. On February 6, 1993 while I was reading my Bible, a verse greatly impressed me: You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit - fruit that will last. Then the Father will give you whatever you ask in my name... \" (John 15:16). Then, I realized that I found the answer to my question. I had come to the U.S. because God had chosen me and had brought me there so that I could come to know Him. That day, I prayed and accepted Jesus as my personal Savior.\nThat night, as I prayed and accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior, I was very restless. I tried to sleep, but questions kept bothering me all night long. \"Was I being culturally assimilated?\" \"Was my conversion a result of cultural shock?\" I got up in the morning and decided that I might be going crazy, but I couldn't do anything about it other than wait and see. A few months later, God answered my questions again. He showed me that even as long ago as when I was 12, He had chosen me and had been preparing me for His kingdom. At that time, I had a dream in which I was swimming. It was very dark, without any stars in the sky. After swimming for a while, I stopped and looked up at the sky. Suddenly, I saw a star shining. I closed my eyes and made a wish. I said, \"Morning Star, teach me the secret of life\". When I woke up, I was deeply affected by my dream. I told my family and my friends about it, but nobody seemed to care. Because I took the dream so seriously, I was even mocked about it. A few days later, however, I forgot about the dream.\nBut the dream did not forget me. About a month later, I had it again. Although I thought it was strange, I didn't really think about it much. But then, a few months later, the same dream came again. I kept having this dream for years almost every other month and this pattern continued until a few months after my conversion, when I read Rev. 22:16, which says, \"I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star\". After reading this verse, I realized that God had been working in my heart for years and that He is a living God. He had brought me to this point to teach me the secret of life - eternal life. That very day, I decided that I would dedicate my whole life to God and follow Him wherever He might lead me. Now, my deepest desire is to follow my Lord as long as I live. In case you're wondering. I've never had the dream again - when the sun rises, one blows the candle out.\nAfter I became a believer in Jesus, my life changed significantly. In the beginning, my family rejected me, but over the years, they observed the positive changes that happened in my life. A couple of years after my conversion, my mother told me that when I first told her that I had decided to follow Jesus, she thought that she had lost her daughter, but now, she knows that she has received back a better one. She tells me now that she believes this has been the best thing that ever happened to me. For years, I didn't believe that my mother loved me, and I hadn't forgiven her for that. But with God, all things are possible. Now, my mom and I are best friends, and she has a desire to know more about God and Christianity.\nAfter my conversion, my family was greatly distressed. They thought that I had brought shame on our family. They thought that we were born as Muslims and destined to die as Muslims. Not only my family, but also many of my friends rejected me. Sometimes, the things I went through lay so heavily on me that many times a day when I thought about my situation, I felt weak and helpless, but I also felt that God was in control. Since the day of my conversion, I have learned what it means to trust God with my life. This takes a lot of faith, but I have learned to live on God's provision \"day by day\". Exodus 16 talks about how God provided for the Israelites day by day when they were in the desert. In the past, I used to think that the Israelites were being ungrateful for God's provision, but as I learned to live on God's provision day-by-day, I understood that, physically and emotionally, this is a difficult place to be. Yet, through it all, I have been thoroughly blessed spiritually.\nA lot of people ask me if becoming a Christian has been worth it. I have asked myself the very same question many times. I love traveling, and I travel a lot. One day while driving alone to give an academic presentation at a national conference, I was trying to practice my talk. But my mind was focused on problems I was facing as a result of my conversion. Suddenly, my disappointments and my fatigue overwhelmed me. Then, I remembered a game (that helped me cope with difficulties) that I used to play a long time ago, a game based on 'dreaming'. When I was five, I was in my grandma's home for summer vacation. One morning, I woke up and found bubble gum all over my bed and on my face. I was pretty sure that my sister had done it. As a little girl, I used to think that my sister was responsible for all of the bad things in the entire universe. I called my aunt and started to complain about my sister. But she didn't listen to me. I think that she knew that my sister was not responsible for all of the bad things that happened in this universe, especially the ones related to me. She took me to the sink and started to clean me up. Angry with me, she spanked me a few times, saying that I wasn't supposed to go to bed with bubble gum. I kept telling her that I didn't chew gum, which was true. But she wasn't listening. It was obvious that we had a communication problem. Then, I stopped listening to her and started to try to make myself believe this was not real, that I was only dreaming. I wanted to wake up and find everything fine. But I didn't wake up. Years later, when my father died, I thought of this incident. As before, I tried to make myself believe that this was not real. In the morning, I was going to wake up, and Dad was going to be with us, and everything was going to be fine. But once again, I didn't wake up. So, that day when I was traveling to the academic conference, I thought, \"Yep, this is a dream. I will wake up, the problems will be gone, and everything will be fine\". Then, immediately, I realized that if I woke up, my faith would be gone too. I would lose my relationship with God. Suddenly I knew that it was worth going through all the problems I have. I would even be willing to endure a lot more in order to have my relationship with God through Christ.\nMy prayer for you is that you can experience the fullness of eternal life in Christ Jesus in your personal life.", "version": "v0"}

Fronted by a superheroine of sound, complete with matching cartoon characters, the Giessen, Germany-based band cranks out original cuts which have a distinct direction. Radio friendly and fueled with intense fervor, the album succeeds in blasting through the usual rock and pop listening territories before reaching higher ground. Here is how.\nAvailable Apr. 26, the title alone, Rise & Fall, is a reflection of how April Art enjoys going against the grain. April Art is Lisa-Marie Watz \u2013 vocals; Chris Bunnell \u2013 guitar; Nico Neufeld \u2013 bass; and Ben Juelg \u2013 drums. Together, the band cranks without a miss, beginning with the 4:30 title cut, which opens the album. The group wastes no time getting down to business. Forget any long drawn out intro, because April Art is already stoked at ten seconds into the song. Guitar driven, an amped solo riff cycles twice before Watz\u2019s vocals kick in and the full melody takes hold. The bass and drum battery is close-fitting, providing superior framework. Watz\u2019s \u201crise and fall\u201d refrain has an anthemically inclusive ring.\nThe second track, \u201cNot Fair,\u201d released in 2018 as the lead single from Rise & Fall, is a contemporary alt-rock melody roaring with intensity. The sound of \u201cNot Fair\u201d is big and can move a lot of air around larger stereo speakers. Bunnell\u2019s passionate attack includes both chording and picking on a solid body, as Neufeld and Juelg maintain a tight pulse. Of course, vocals and lyrics play an important part in the overall April Art plan. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair, it\u2019s not fair to deny,\u201d warns Watz in the singer\u2019s own forceful style. As with each of the songs from Rise & Fall, the recording\u2019s production mix is superior. Meanwhile, the accompanying video is funny while briefly taking a swipe at out-of-touch music industry types.\nBy cut three from Rise & Fall, \u201cYou Want It All,\u201d it\u2019s easy to hear how the band has created a distinct sound. In the song\u2019s music video, featuring green plastic toy army men, it looks as though Bunnell might be wielding a seven string axe, while Neufeld\u2019s bass may be a five string. In any case, the music is dramatic, melodic and stinging. The same applies to \u201cLife In The Fast Lane,\u201d where Bunnell\u2019s expertise and amplitude shines. For something a bit more syncopated, try \u201cDesire and Yearning\u201d or \u201cResistance.\u201d \u201cWhere Do We Go\u201d returns to more of a rock approach and \u201cJealously\u201d is thick with distortion. But you will have to decide which songs help burnish April Art\u2019s reputation as rockers.", "version": "v0"}

Moreover, as researches are exploring new possibilities, I think it\u2019s very clear what an environmentally sustainable alternative the kingdom of fungi offers to already existing mundane things such as packaging, bricks or even paper.\nSo why would the fashion industry be the exception to this rule? Even though inspiration might come from past trends, designers are up to experimenting with different things in their humane quest to innovate the craft. Nowadays, probably the most inspiring tool is provided by technology which offers a new and limitless playground. Also, this technology is used for testing ideas for products with smaller impact on the environment, a subject that keeps on expanding as the concern regarding the future of our planet is growing. Thus, it seems more than logical that the second most polluting industry on Earth should look for ecological alternatives.\nOne such initiative comes to life through Neffa company. Their name means in Dutch \u201cwanting to do things just that bit differently\u201d and their self-described mission is \u201cto create textiles that act like living organisms and with which we live in symbiosis\u201d. They aim to create materials using biotechnology that would resemble the skin and its dynamic. They are researching several organisms, for example algae and mycelium, but what I\u2019ll be talking about is how the company uses mycelium to create a sort of textile, which they called mycoTex.\nThe soul of the company is Aniela Hoitink, a textile designer. In the beginning she was interested in creating a textile out of a living product, which will eventually end up in a wearable piece of clothing. That is how she began experimenting with mycelium that is the vegetative part of a fungus. What encouraged her in using the mycelium were the insulating and moisture-absorbing proprieties of it, which a lot of textiles miss. However, she was not alone in her endeavor: the University of Utrecht and Maurizio Montalti were helping with the technical part. What they tried to experiment with was: growing mycelium onto natural fibers, growing it with polymer spacer fabrics and growing it in a 3D star shaped petri-dish.\nSome of the initial findings of these experiments were that mycelium does not grow on a tight knitted or woven fabric and that mycelium does not use the textile as a food source.\nEventually, Aniela developed the composite product named MycoTex and then decided to build a textile out of modules and shaped these circular pieces around a body form, thus creating the Neffa dress. This creation is groundbreaking because it can be built whilst being made, fitting the customer\u2019s wishes, because it eliminates the possible leftovers made during the process and it can be composted when it\u2019s no longer desired.\nAnother such invention came to life by the hands of Danish product designer Jonas Edward, who created a material called MYX, which is grown from mushroom spores and plant fibers. His idea combines natural plant fibers (agricultural waste) and oyster mycelium. During the production of the material which takes about two weeks, the mycelium spreads through the textile matt (hemp and linen fibers), behaving like a glue between the fibers. The mycelium who continues to collect energy from the plant material, breaks down the cellulose into sugar, in this way producing mushrooms ready to be eaten! (If the material is dried, there will be no \u201coffsprings\u201d). In the end, the creation of this material, from which the designer made a lamp with, produces no waste \u2013 something that the creator aimed for and which is also a great achievement in today\u2019s manufacturing.", "version": "v0"}

His cell phone died. The phone is only a few months old.\nSeems like more and more gadgets are dying prematurely these days. Of course, this could just be a side effect of the fact that we own more electronic gadgets. This could also be an effect of price competition, and the market seeking the lowest level of quality that consumers will accept.\nThere is another possible explanation. Assume you were in the role of a rising economic and military power - like China. If you were hoping to one day achieve military dominance, somehow you need to undercut the superiority of the US military. A direct attack is likely to be very expensive, so you need to find something less obvious.\nThe superiority of the US military is largely based on technology originally developed during the Cold War. Without the threat of imminent destruction, the rate of US innovation is bound to drop. Certainly you want to avoid any appearance as a direct threat. At the same time, military technology is largely dependent on electronics. If you can undercut prices, then you can kill off manufacturing in the US. You only need to do this for a few critical components - no need to capture the entire market (which might arose suspicion).\nFor example, capacitors are simple relatively low-tech components that are used in practically every electronic device. Not a lot of innovation going on with capacitors, so it is quite natural that the manufacturing would shift to where costs were lowest. If you can insure that your costs are lowest, you can slowly reduce the lifespan of the component, so that any electronic device is bound to fail within a few years. You might be able to manufacture components with a longer lifespan at the same cost - but you make sure that components offered for export have a short lifespan.\nThe consumer market is not going to care overmuch, as consumer devices tend to have a short lifespan in any case. Slowly increasing failure rates mean the US military spends an increasing amount of time and money for maintenance, and has less money for improvements. Higher failure rates mean lower readiness and a weaker military. If for any reason replacements became scarce (due to some sort of conflict - economic or military) then in the space of a few years the US military could become radically less effective.\nNever ascribe to malice - in this case what could be simply explained by market forces. So I am not a big believer in the above. Still, it is a possibility.\nA simple strategy should suffice to nullify an \u201cattack\u201d like the above, and return a long-term benefit to the country as a whole. Simply insure that a sufficient pool of expertise exists so that we can resume domestic manufacturing when needed. In the short term this means a steady supply of high reliability components (with the side benefit of lower maintainence costs and higher readiness for our military). In the long term the disparity between domestic and foreign manufacturing costs will diminish, and the country gains an economic benefit. Modest long-term investments in improved manufacturing techniques both insure that our domestic expertise does not die of old age, and is likely to bring closer the day when domestic manufacturing is again competitive.", "version": "v0"}

He wasn\u2019t going to make that mistake again, not in Flint, not on the Sunday before a critical primary in a state that\u2019s home to some of the most besieged black cities in the country.\nThe early narrative of the Democratic primary centered on Sanders\u2019 dominance among younger voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, but Hillary Clinton\u2019s dominance among African-Americans has pushed the Vermont senator to the brink, and he spent the better part of two hours trying to make up lost ground, taking full advantage of the debate\u2019s background themes of urban decay and institutional racism.\nSanders \u2014 who in earlier debates displayed an uncanny habit of steering any debate question back to the country-crushing predations of the financial services industry \u2014 spoke a lot less about Wall Street and a lot more about issues like drug sentencing laws, big-city infrastructure and his early fights against racism as a college student.\nBut the hole is deep (Clinton has won by 50- to 60-point margins in Southern states), the former secretary of state had her own story to tell, and she bested the Vermont senator during a testy exchange on gun control.\nOne debate probably didn\u2019t do it for Sanders, yet if the Clinton team hoped Sanders would go gently, the fierce urgency of his performance portends a long campaign still ahead \u2014 even if he loses Michigan, as polls suggest he will. Here are five takeaways.\n1 Wonk this way. Clinton didn\u2019t stage a dramatic reading of her absolutely, unbelievably fantastic numbers in the latest CNN poll, Sanders didn\u2019t talk up the size of an appendage (other than his elephantine online fundraising operation) and neither called the other short, sweaty, dumb, duplicitous, lyin\u2019 or little.\n\u201cI don\u2019t intend to get into the gutter with whomever they nominate,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe are going to invest a lot of money into mental health, and if you watch these Republican debates, you know why!\u201d he said.\nThe Democrats get to gloat about how much more substantive they are than the Republicans, and they have an indisputable point. Whether you agreed with them or not on policy, they actually talked knowledgeably about some \u2014 engaging in substantive (if often nitpicky) discussion of student debt, infrastructure development, health care and welfare reform. The timing (Sunday night) and tameness of the debate (spitting mad, they both got, over the Export-Import Bank!) virtually guaranteed pathetic ratings, the worst possible outcome in Trump-speak.\nDonald Trump, whose ignorance of basic governmental realities (at times he seems to have struggled with core concepts such as separation of powers or the fact that a president can be impeached for flouting, rather than enforcing, existing laws) won\u2019t \u201cwear well,\u201d Clinton predicted. If history is any guide, time is on the Democrats\u2019 side \u2014 in the form of a general electorate that tends to sleep off an intoxicated spring for a more sober autumn.\n2. Spirit of Trump makes a cameo. All politicians brag. The difference between Trump and everyone else is that he seems to have been born without the part of the hippocampus that generates even a little bit of self-deprecation. But he\u2019s raised the volume of the campaign, no doubt about it, and not just on the Republican side.\nThat thing he does where he bellows out the latest polls (after barely besting Ted Cruz in Kentucky and Louisiana on Saturday, he crowed about a recent survey showing him with half the GOP primary vote), well, the Democrats have started doing it too. For about three minutes, albeit very mildly, Clinton and Sanders traded barbed boasts about their own numbers.\nTrump, she said, has gotten about 3.6 million votes thus far. That\u2019s nice. \u201cThere\u2019s just one more candidate who has more votes, and it\u2019s me!\u201d she said, referring to her estimated 4 million-vote tally, over a million more than Sanders has received.\n3. Sanders (finally) gets personal. For all his curmudgeonly cuddliness \u2014 in Iowa, for instance, one prominent Clinton supporter professed to be cuted-out by Sanders and wanted to un-muss his hair \u2014 he is surprisingly closed-off when it comes to sharing his personal experiences. Part of the reason is his stated mission to make the campaign about issues, not personality. Plus, he\u2019s simply a naturally reticent person.\nIt\u2019s hard to tell what impact that\u2019s had on his campaign, but African-American voters tend to expect more personal candor from their candidates than New Englanders or college-campus habitu\u00e9s. Sanders, for the first time in this campaign, seemed willing, even eager, to connect \u2014 and he jumped on a question about his personal experiences with racism to talk about his arrest, as a University of Chicago student in the 1960s, during an anti-racism protest.\nBut the question that really picked Sanders\u2019 emotional lock was an Anderson Cooper query about why he didn\u2019t speak much about his Jewishness on the campaign trail. \u201cI am very proud to be Jewish, and being Jewish is so much of who I am. Look, my father\u2019s family was wiped out\u201d by the Nazis, he said.\n4. Hillary scores big on guns, auto bailout. In general, both candidates gave as good as they got. But there was one exchange that played in Clinton\u2019s favor (at least in the primaries) and it zeroed in on what Brooklyn sees as Sanders\u2019 most vulnerable issue: his opposition to a gun-control measure that would make weapons manufacturers liable for killings.\nThe issue resonates with African-American voters whose communities have been ravaged by gun violence. Clinton, responding to a question posed by the father of a young girl severely wounded in the recent rampage by an Uber driver in nearby Kalamazoo, complained that Sanders had voted to grant gun-makers \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d in the Senate.\nSanders responded with an answer befitting his day job as a senator in Vermont, where hunting is a bipartisan staple sport, or as a general election candidate, but one that may not play among the hyperliberal Democratic primary electorate: \u201cWhat you\u2019re really talking about is ending gun manufacturing in America,\u201d Sanders said \u2014 a statement the Clinton campaign will quickly spin as standing up for the gun lobby.\nThe exchange that got Clinton\u2019s team most revved up was this one over President Barack Obama\u2019s auto bailout \u2014 Clinton voted for it, Sanders opposed it.\n5. Bill comes due. Seldom has a 2016 debate been such a back-to-the-future exercise, in this case the 1990s. A key part of Sanders\u2019 argument against Clinton is that her husband\u2019s 1996 welfare reform law increased poverty and contributed to a culture in which poor, black people were \u201cscapegoated\u201d for being disadvantaged. He also hammered her on free trade \u2014 referring to Bill Clinton\u2019s signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement \u2014 and threw in a few negative comments about Bill\u2019s crime bill (which imposed mandatory minimum drug sentences that disproportionately affected poor blacks).\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to argue about the \u201990s, let\u2019s try to get the facts straight,\u201d a hoarse and peeved Clinton shot back \u2014 before touting her husband\u2019s successes in shrinking the deficit, expanding employment and increasing black household incomes.", "version": "v0"}

This was then followed by John Swinney announcing at the SNP conference that local authorities in Scotland would also be given the power to cut business rates by the end of October 2015. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, has proclaimed that, no longer will local authorities, and the local areas they represent, have to march to Central Government with a begging bowl for handouts. Two dichotomous trends are prevalent in recent commentaries. The first is positive; some local authorities and pressure groups have generally welcomed the announcement as an opportunity for local authorities to stand on their own two feet and exploit their local wealth. The second is more circumspect, concerning the potential impact of the 2020 changes, in relation to equality between areas and the potential race to the bottom following the announcement that local authorities will be able to reduce the business rate multiplier at the local level.\nThe reality of the situation is currently difficult to fathom ahead of the impending Public Spending Review. However, what is positive is the exposure that this traditionally esoteric issue has received in recent weeks and the opportunity for debate that has been revealed. This debate, and the overall uncertainty, raises multiple concerns in relation to the long term security of public sector service delivery in England. Primarily, how will authorities securitize public sector service delivery through the performance of local property markets? This is especially prominent in relation to the announcement by the Local Government Association that a dozen local authorities are on the brink of financial failure. The remainder of this article is structured around a series of critical questions that probe the uncertainties and ambiguities in the recent announcements in relation of Business Rates and Business Rate Retention.\nThe original Business Rate Retention Scheme (BRRS) gave local authorities the potential to retain 50% of business rate income and up to 50% any of growth in business rates revenue from new assessments added to the rating list, synonymous with construction of new employment (commercial and industrial) floorspace.The remainder was returned to Central Government and redistributed in England in a similar way to the previous Formula Grant method of funding. The Chancellor's recent announcement has extended the 50% principle to 100%. Local authorities will now be able to retain and exploit 100% of local business rates income but what does this actually mean? The consequence is that some locations will be net winners and some will be net losers. However, there still appears to still be an element of equalisation in the scheme as the top up and tariff mechanism will remain active. In other words it will still be growth above a baseline that will be important at the local level.\nThe Chancellor's announcement would appear to suggest that local authorities now have the potential to retain all growth in the value of local business rates. However, upon closer examination the reality is that local authorities will only be able to retain growth associated with the addition of net new floorspace or new assessments added to the rating list. Any increase in the value of existing floorspace over time (traditionally captured by the national rateable valuation exercise) will still be stripped out of business rate income (see Muldoon-Smith and Greenhalgh 2015). In other words it is only possible to create business rate growth through the construction of new business properties, any increase in the value of existing business stock is precluded.\nIt is important to note that the Uniform Business Rate has not been abolished; it will still exist (although it may be called something else). All that has changed is the ability for local authorities to lower this rate at the local level if they so wish. It seems likely that the national rate will still operate in the same fashion following national revaluation. This means that any location that does not have the space to accommodate new construction, or does not have the underlying rental values to support new development, will be at a disadvantage. Therefore there are question in relation to what type of local growth is getting the boost, economic growth, new jobs or new property development? If the latter, there is the risk of displacing existing businesses from older properties if new floor space development is not matched with a concomitant increase in occupier demand. This may also lead to an increase in rateable value appeals. This is because the value of existing property could be affected in those locations where businesses have vacated (because of blight) and also in new development locations, where the value of older premises decrease as new property is added in to the local property supply (counteracting the windfall of new development).\nWhat are the implications of a reduced local rate of taxation?\nThe Chancellor has suggested that local authorities will now have the power to lower the rate of business rate taxation in order to attract new businesses. This is potentially a positive development, however, what are the implications for local authority budget setting and planning? Presumably, any reduction in the local business rate will reduce the overall business rate income for a local authority and reduce the ability to fund services. Yes, the influx of new businesses will contribute to the local economy, but how will that contribution be captured and fed back into the funding of public services? Those local authorities already facing budgetary pressures will not countenance a further decrease in local taxation. Presumably, only those authorities with a budget surplus will have sufficient budgetary tolerance. Therefore, it is unlikely that there will be a race to the bottom as local authorities compete for new business.\nThere is also some uncertainty in relation to the flexibility of any reduction in the local business rate level. Will it be uniform at the local level or will local authorities have the ability to adjust taxation for different types of property, businesses and locations? For instance will it be possible to remove small businesses from business rate taxation all together?\nWhat about empty property rates?\nSurprisingly the current debate has largely ignored the issue of empty property rates. Currently landlords pay a tax on empty business properties equal to the maximum business rate multiplier, currently set at 0.49p in the \u00a3. If local authorities are to have the power to lower the business rate, then they should also be given powers to alter the current level of empty property rate liability. There could even be room to consider removing empty property rate liability altogether in certain locations. In the current system small businesses, those businesses who underpin the new economy, pay business rates in accordance with a smaller business rate multiplier (0.48p in the \u00a3), they are more likely to receive discretionary rate relief and are also more likely to either go bust or move quickly to new property if their circumstances change. Under business rate retention, the higher rate of empty property liability means that local authorities are not rewarded with any additional income from attracting new businesses into existing vacant premises. This further reinforces the point that local authorities only benefit from the proceeds of new development. Failure to include empty property rates in the recent announcements is a missed opportunity. If Government abolished empty property rates this would incentivise local authorities to promote indigenous economic growth by rewarding them for creating conditions whereby vacant space is reoccupied. Rather than the current situation where they get penalised.\nThe current business rate retention scheme has a safety net in place for those local authorities that see a reduction in business rate income by more than 7.5%. This ensures that there is an element of redistribution in business rate retention. However, there is also an element of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. Although the safety net is welcomed, what is the point in this redistribution if local businesses have already left an area in a flight to quality towards those locations that have been able to construct new business floorspace? The Netherlands provides an example, in recent decades, of a country that followed an entrepreneurial model of local government finance based on property. Following a period of deregulation, municipal locations pushed through new office space construction without any obvious demand for it. The consequence was a glut of supply which prompted market filtering and displacement as existing occupiers moved into new office space at comparable rents to their previous property, generating eye watering vacancy rates in less resilient locations. In the Netherlands structural vacancy (e.g. business properties without any obvious relationship with demand) is a perennial concern. There is even a specific set of government ordnance measures to deal with this concern. Do the recent announcements indicate a similar trend in England? Perversely, local authorities who have seen a net reduction in business rate income, but not by 7.5%, may welcome more loss to take them over the threshold as they will then receive a windfall from the safety net. These local authorities exist in a stranded limbo, unable to exploit growth and unable to access the safety net.\nIt is also worth noting that recent commentaries presume that the 7.5% safety net will stay in place in its current state; as yet, there isn't any confirmation of this. The Chancellor's announcement indicates that local authorities will now be able to keep all growth above the baseline position. In the previous scheme this ability was capped and any disproportionate growth was paid to Central Government via a levy. It is this levy that was designed to cash flow the safety net and one off regeneration schemes such as the New Development Deal areas in Newcastle, Sheffield and Nottingham (which exist outside of the national business rate retention scheme). Now that this levy has been abolished (and given that the original levy contribution was not enough to fund the safety net in the first place) it is unclear how the new safety net provision, or one of regeneration schemes like New Development Deal areas, will be funded. A mechanism is already in place to fund the existing short fall in safety net payments through the Settlement Funding Assessment. Presumably, this mechanism could be extended, with a top slice of the Settlement Funding Exercise paying for the unfunded safety net facility.\nWhat are the implications of the infrastructure levy?\nHow will the new local infrastructure levy work in practice? At first glance it looks like a classic Business Improvement District (BID), where businesses in a defined area agree to pay an extra level of business rates, after a local ballot, to fund local improvements. Importantly, under a BID, a majority of business in a defined area have to vote in favour of an uplift in property tax. However, under the infrastructure levy scheme there isn't any provision for a local ballot. Rather, an elected Mayor would only need to secure the agreement from a majority of private sector Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) members. This opens up a discussion in relation to the democratisation of fiscal decentralisation, especially in relation to who decides and who pays for new local infrastructure.\nSo far the emphasis has been on local authorities in England and the introduction ahead of 2020. However, John Swinney announced at the SNP conference that all 32 local authorities in Scotland would be given the power to lower the rate of tax on business property on the 31st October 2015 under powers in the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act passed in June this year. Business rates work differently in Scotland, the rate is set nationally but the proceeds are already retained locally. However, what is different is the time frame for the changes (the end of this month) announced at the SNP conference and the greater detail in relation to the flexibility of the new power. Local authorities in Scotland will be able to lower the rate against local criteria, such as the type of property, its location, occupation and activity. So far, this level of detail has not been released in the English proposals.\nWithin all of the hyperbole surrounding business rate devolution, the fact remains that local authorities can only plan their spending in the medium to long term if they have a degree of certainty in relation to future income. Under the current system this is not possible. Although Central Government has transferred 100% of existing business rates and potential growth to local areas, they have also transferred 100% of the risk. It is worth noting that there hasn't been any additional finance given to local authorities, only its potential. The issue of risk is particularly important in relation to the rateable value appeal process. Local authorities are liable for the cost of any successful appeal back-dated to 2010 (and beyond where historical appeals have not been resolved), three years before the existing business rate retention scheme went live in 2013. In the current scheme, they are only liable for 50% of this liability; after 2020 this will increase to 100%. Many local authorities already find that the cost of successful backdated appeals more than outweighs the proceeds of any growth. The new proposals will only make this issue worse. Without decoupling both empty property rates and the liability for rateable valuation appeals from business rate retention, it will not be possible to derive economic growth from the existing business rate model.\nThere is still a great deal of uncertainty in relation to the 2020 business rate changes and what the practical impact will be in local areas up and down England (Scotland is moving ahead even quicker). As ever, the devil will be in the detail, however, what seems certain is that change is around the corner in England (and the devolved administrations) and that local authorities will be expected to fend for themselves. Developing urban models and systems of intelligence that can monitor and help manage and plan these new systems of urban finance will be central to ensuring the on-going security and resilience of public sector service provision in the 21st Century. Paramount in this concern will be securing, harnessing and exploiting the power of urban data. In recent years R3 Intelligence has developed a hybrid, multi-criteria urban property information model for all locations in the UK, which has the underlying ability to monitor, manage and plan business rate retention activity. The resource utilises existing and new forms of data to provide baseline monitoring and future scenario modelling in order to plan the urban finance, property market and public service interrelation.\nFor more information on R3 Intelligence services and products click here.", "version": "v0"}

The contest was held this weekend.\nA tape measure was used to measure the shark and according to the association, the mako measured 83 \u00bc inches. The weigh-in was witnessed by a state conservation officer under the hire by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the association said.\nHowever, the same shark was disqualified in the Mako Fever tournament, taking place at the same time on the Manasquan River and run by the Jersey Coast Shark Anglers in Brick.\nMako Fever disqualified the shark for being undersized, according to the tournament's social media account. A video posted on the tournament's social media showed the shark was measured with a straight ruler and the shark was 79 inches long.\nA conservation officer was also present at the dock to witness the weigh-in at Mako Fever.\nA spokesperson for NOAA, which has final say on issuing citations on the taking of illegal sharks, said the agency's standard practice is not to discuss ongoing or potential investigations.\nSequester is in first place in Mako Mania, but tournament committeeman Bob Gynn said they haven't awarded the prize money yet and have postponed the awards ceremony until a ruling is made on the shark.\n\"Were yet to make a determination on it and are taking many things into factor,\" said Gynn.\nThe owner of Sequester was not able to reached by a reporter.\nIf Sequester is disqualified, first place would go to the crew of Miss Jenny, which entered a qualifying thresher shark into Mako Mania.\nSequester's shark is not big enough for first place in Mako Fever, which had a 258-pound mako and a 236-pound mako entered by contestants.\nMako Fever's tournament director John Schabel did not immediately return a phone call.\nPete Grimbilas, former director of Mako Mania, said part of the debate is over what is the correct way to measure a shark.\n\"I see it as two different things. It's either measured along the curve of the shark or straight. I've seen it reported both ways by NOAA,\" said Grimbalis.\nMeasuring along the curve of the shark's body would give a longer measurement.\nThe ocean water temperature was starting to inch up into the lower 60s.\nThe water got warm enough for a shot of porgies over the rocky bottom on the northern Monmouth County coastline. But, a couple days in a row of south wind and current brought the cold water back.\n\"It went down eight degrees. It was 63 degrees and now it's 55,\" Captain William Egerter of the Dauntless said Thursday morning.\nHe was out in 110-feet of water catching sea bass, ling and winter flounder. Egerter spoke to divers who reported the water was 12 degrees colder on the bottom.\nWhen the temps were warm, the ocean fluking picked up.\nCaptain Matt Sosnowski of the Norma K III party boat said he observed more bites on the fluking grounds outside the Manasquan Inlet as a result.\nThe fluke in the rivers has been steady so far this young season.\nThere are some true doormats lining the bottom of the Manasquan River. Julia Stavalo of Lacey was fishing on the Hat Trick with Mike Caufield Jr. when she hooked into and reeled in a 10-pound, 12-ounce fish not too far from the railroad bridge.\nThe report was sent in by Mike Caufield Sr.\nThe fluke fishing also began to pick up in the Sandy Hook and Raritan bays. Tom Buban of the Atlantic Star party boat said he had a good showing of keepers on the morning and afternoon trips.\n\"The fluke fishing has been pretty good I really have no complaints. We are catching some nice size fluke. Our biggest fish this week went 7 \u00bd pounds,\" said Captain Rob Semkewyc on the Sea Hunter in Atlantic Highlands.\nThe sea bass fishing on the inshore hard bottom in 110 feet or less of water has been good. The cold water made the fish a little finicky this week.\nThe inshore reefs like the Sea Girt and Axel Carlson are holding the bass but not enough for the larger crowds on the party boats, said Egerter.\n\"A little boat that can hit a bunch of spots can catch eight or 10 a man on the reefs,\" said Egerter.\nFishermen have been lighting up the bluefish inshore. Captain Howard Bogan Jr. of the 125-foot Jamaica said the fish were on the surface and hitting on metal jigs.\nThe night bluefishing is a different story. Sosnowski has been trying on Friday and Saturday nights but said they ended up anchoring on a wreck last weekend and catching ling instead.\nThere's no doubt a 30-pound halibut is going to pull a little harder than a four or five-pound fluke.\nBut you're not going to catch that fish in New Jersey waters. But Jeff Gutman, captain of the Voyager party boat in Point Pleasant Beach can take you where there are.\nGutman ran into a patch of big halibut drifting patrons over the Nantucket shoals on his latest excursion to the Rhode Island coast.\nGutman took his fares there for two days at the end of May. The trip focused on jigging cod and haddock, the latter he said they found in good numbers.\n\"Fish were coming up all around the boat on both bait and jigs with doubleheaders common,\" said Gutman.\nIn the middle of day two of the trip, an angler hooked into something much larger off the bottom. It turned out to be a 36-pound halibut landed by Andre Mezzasalma of Virginia.\n\"We hooked a few more halibut through the day but were unable to get any to the surface,\" said Gutman.\nCaptain Dave DeGennaro of the Hi Flier motored southeast from the Barnegat Inlet to the Spencer Canyon on Sunday.\nDeGennaro said they found the \"right water,\" which was a \"beautiful shade of blue.\"\nThe canyon had tons of porpoise and whales and skipjack tuna, which attacked his spread every five to 10 minutes. His group put one bluefin tuna in the boat.\nA new fluke contest this year, the two-month long \"Flukin Fiesta\" contest is underway.\nThis fluke tournament runs from June 2 to July 29 and offers anglers cash prizes for the two heaviest fluke weighed in. Anglers must use a rod and reel to land the fluke and the contest is open to all New Jersey waters. Contestants can register up until July 28.\nThe contest is sponsored by the St. Peter School PTA, located in Point Pleasant Beach. The entry fee is $75.\nRegistration forms are available at participating weigh stations: Elliots Auto Car, Hoffman's Marina, Round Dough with a Hole, Barnegat Bay Marina and Pells Fish and Sport.\nForms can also be downloaded from the contest's Facebook \"2018 Flukin Fiesta.\"\nThe 40th annual Mako Fever contest run by the Jersey Coast Shark Anglers kick's off this weekend.\nThe captain meeting is today at 6:30 p.m. at the Manasquan River Club, 217 Riverside Dr. Brick. The entry fee is $500.\nNew this year is the shark contest will run from June 16-June 24. Participants can also weigh in a thresher shark, though the contest remains a mako first tournament.\nThe weigh-ins are 4 to 8 p.m. daily at the Crystal Point Yacht Club at 3900 River Road, Point Pleasant.\nThe captain's meeting is 6:30 p.m. June 22 at Wehrlen Brother's Marina in Brick. The weigh-ins are 4 to 7 p.m. June 23 and 24 at Captain Bill's Landing in Point Pleasant Beach.", "version": "v0"}

Although Terry provides only for an officer \u201cto conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing \u2026 in an attempt to discover weapons which might be used to assault him,\u201d id., 392 U.S. at 30, we hold that under these circumstances the search was properly broadened to encompass the opening of Limon\u2019s purse. Here, again, we agree with the trial court that Limon\u2019s purse was essentially an extension of her person where the purse was accessible by her, and because the officers were concerned for their safety, \u201cthey should be able to protect themselves to the extent that if they are concerned, they should be able to find if there are weapons on the person or close enough to the person where that person can cause harm to the officer.\u201d See generally Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032, 1034-35, 1047 (1983) (expanding Terry protective search for weapons to encompass area beyond the person so as to justify search of passenger compartment of vehicle and further noting that \u201c Terry need not be read as restricting the preventative search to the person of the detained suspect\u201d).\n\u00b637 Limon disagrees and suggests that the officers should have patted down her purse as opposed to \u201cdiving into it.\u201d The record is silent, however, regarding whether Limon\u2019s purse was cloth, leather, vinyl, or some other material, making it unclear whether a pat-down would have been worthwhile.\n\u00b612 But the State must also justify the immediate search of the purse after it was in Officer Stewart\u2019s control. After the purse\u2019s seizure, the danger of Appellant using something in it to harm herself or others was removed. Generally, once a purse is no longer in its owner\u2019s possession, a protective search of the purse is not justified pursuant to Terry. See State v. Schellhorn, 769 P.2d 221, 223 (Or. Ct. App. 1989) (\u201c[O]nce the officer had seized the purse, he no longer had any reason to believe that it still posed an immediate threat to him.\u201d); People v. Stewart, 420 N.W.2d 180, 181-82 (Mich. Ct. App. 1988) (holding that the search of purses could not be justified as a protective search for weapons when police had control of the purses); State v.

Everyone thinks they know everything about the Irish.\nHere is where I want to dispel every assumption about Irish families, but the reality is I can\u2019t.\nYeah, my family loves carbs. Bread, potatoes, you name it. We love it, and we aren\u2019t afraid to admit it.\nWherever my mom\u2019s side holds a family reunion, the location pretty much becomes the third most populated city in South Dakota. We all genuinely try to remember everyone\u2019s name, but it seems like there is a new name to remember every other month. My mother is one of 10 children. Three branches of her family\u2019s tree have more than six children \u2014 and counting.\nBig families, carbs and Catholicism. That\u2019s the big three. When I\u2019m having an issue, my mom is quick on the draw with the patron saint I can pray to for a resolution.\nWhen you grow up in a big family, I guess it is natural to wonder where the hell all of these people came from.\nMy mother, Rebecca, is the daughter of Elgin Edward Lemon and Ann Keating.\nElgin died before I was born. I never got to know his side\u2019s story. His grandparents came to America by way of Germany in the mid-1800s and settled in the Midwest. His parents were farmers, he was in the Navy during World War II and, according to my mom, he liked routines. And disliked when they were broken.\nAnn was raised in Yankton, South Dakota, where she still lives and where five of her 10 children live. The Keating side of the family is so well documented someone could write a book about them.\nI have gotten the best impression of the roots of my family from the stories I have heard about the Keatings. My dad, Jeff Bowden, is from a small, tight-knit family. I haven\u2019t ever gotten to know much about his side outside of my grandparents and my one aunt\u2019s family.\nAnn\u2019s paternal grandparents, Edward and Mary Keating, came to America from Ireland in the mid-1800s and met in Wisconsin. They had 14 children; only 10 lived into adulthood. John Laurence was the 14th child born to Edward and Mary. He is my grandmother\u2019s father.\nRumor has it Mary, who was widowed when John was five, had a tough time keeping John in check. He was a big fighter (check fighting Irish off the Irish assumptions list). He only ever attained a fourth grade education, which wasn\u2019t all that uncommon.\nJohn grew up and moved to Yankton, where he began working at his brother Frank\u2019s creamery. Keating Creamery would later be called Keating Dairy, but it started out selling only butter. When milk was added to the list of products, it could officially be called a dairy.\nMary liked Wisconsin because it reminded her of Ireland. Her children working in South Dakota got her to move West in the early 1900s, but she moved back to Wisconsin two years later because the plains weren\u2019t enough like her old country.\nMy grandma Ann\u2019s mother was Patricia Hart. She was John Keating\u2019s second wife. He had two children with his first wife, who died in 1922 of tuberculosis. John and Patricia had five children together.\nPatricia was my great grandmother\u2019s name on her birth certificate, but everyone called her Bob. Her father, Patrick, who had three daughters and a son at the time Patricia was born, wanted to name another son Bob. So he called his daughter Bob.\nPatrick was born in Canada. His parents, Cormac and Winifred, both came to Canada from Ireland because it was $10 cheaper than sailing to America.\nPatrick moved from a small town in Ontario to Minnesota by way of covered wagon. He married my great-great grandmother Ellen in Minnesota. Ellen\u2019s parents were both born in County Kilkenny, Ireland.

The outcome of their study provided recommendations on ways to strengthen monitoring, control and surveillance arrangements, to help minimize the future financial impact of IUU on Pacific Island economies.\nThe main benefit of the Palisade software was how it enabled us to easily deal with the high levels of uncertainty surrounding illegal fishing. The level of available information was very limited for many risks, due to the secretive nature of IUU fishing. However, after we generated the \u2018best estimate\u2019 and minimum and maximum range values, @RISK enabled us to account for uncertainty in the underlying information, and produce probabilistic estimates of IUU activity.\nMRAG Asia Pacific (MRAG AP) is an independent fisheries and aquatic resource consulting company based in Brisbane, Australia. An international leader in the field of aquatic resource consulting, the company is dedicated to promoting sustainable use of natural resources through sound integrated management policies and practices. MRAG AP used Palisade\u2019s @RISK software to estimate the volume, species composition and value of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing in Pacific Islands tuna fisheries. The outcome of their study provided recommendations on ways to strengthen monitoring, control and surveillance arrangements, to help minimize the future financial impact of IUU on Pacific Island economies. Their work was covered in the report, Towards the Quantification of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing in the Pacific Islands Region, published in February 2016.\nIllegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing is a global problem that results in significant financial losses every year. Previous attempts to estimate the damages put the value between US$707 million and more than US$1.5 billion per year in the Western Pacific Ocean area alone. However, IUU fishing by its very nature is secretive, making it extremely difficult to accurately quantify the nature and extent of potential damages, as well as plan for effective Monitoring, Control and Surveillance (MCS) activities.\nAs part of a European Union-funded project, MRAG AP was commissioned to estimate the volume and value of IUU fishing in the tuna fisheries of the Pacific Islands region. The company took a \u2018bottom up\u2019 approach to the study, analysing detailed information at a local scale in an effort to build a more accurate picture of IUU fishing activity, particularly the variation in the nature and scale of IUU activity associated with each IUU risk in each main fishery. Estimates obtained in this way were then added together to develop an overall estimate of IUU catch and value.\nAccording to Duncan Souter, CEO of MRAG AP, \u201cThe challenge with this approach is that it is time-consuming and information is often very patchy and hard to collect. There are therefore many gaps to fill that require analytical methodologies of varying degrees and complexity.\u201d For this study, the company broke down the \u2018IUU problem\u2019 into discrete, quantifiable units \u2013 volume, species composition and value \u2013 before aggregating them up to produce a regional scale estimate.\nGenerating these estimates involved multiple steps. First, MRAG AP identified the IUU risks for each of its main fishing sectors, including unlicensed fishing, misreporting, underreporting and illegal transhipping. Then, the company studied available information to generate a \u2018best estimate\u2019 level of IUU activity, as well as minimum and maximum ranges. \u201cThe quality and nature of the information varied considerably between risks,\u201d explained Souter. \u201cRelatively precise \u2018best estimates\u2019 could be assigned to some risks based on available information, while others were more subjective, for example estimates of illegal transhipment activity.\u201d Once these values had been assigned, the company defined a probability distribution of IUU activity within this range, using the distribution fitting tool where good observable data existed. Triangular distributions were used where there was a reasonable level of confidence that the level of IUU activity was likely to be close to the \u2018best estimate\u2019, and uniform distributions were used when the information wasn\u2019t as certain.\nFor this study, MRAG AP modelled potential illegal fish catch using a combination of literature, fishery data and monitoring activities as inputs, which provided values for likely illegal catch outcomes. The company then estimated the cost of illegal catches by applying known market values for each main tuna species and product type to the estimate IUU volumes and species composition in each fishery sector.\nMRAG had 570,000 data points for one part of the model, so they also used the distribution fitting to estimate plausible input distributions. \u201c@RISK is very user friendly, considering the complex analytical techniques we were undertaking, and provided useful outputs that allowed clear presentation of our results,\u201d added Souter.\nBased on the results of the study, several Monitoring, Control and Surveillance (MCS) activities were identified to mitigate IUU fishing in the Pacific Islands including strengthening on-board monitoring of fishing activity through improved observer coverage and the introduction of electronic monitoring technology. In addition, the study has provided a framework for the quantification of IUU fishing in Pacific tuna fisheries, and the design of a basic model that can be refined and updated over time as IUU risks change and better information becomes available.\n\u201cThe over-riding message from the report is that the Pacific has come a long way in combatting IUU fishing, but more needs to be done. The challenge now is to ensure that MCS efforts focus on the areas of highest risk, and that estimates of IUU activity continue to come down over time,\u201d said Souter.", "version": "v0"}

Intelsat is talking to Orbital ATK (which is also in discussions with SES) and says it will be the debut customer of Orbital\u2019s planned fleet of 5 such repair and service satellites. The first is scheduled for launch in 2018 and to be used in 2019, and is part of a $1 billion scheme for orbiting satellite repair craft.\nInitially the satellites will operate as \u2018mission extension vehicles\u2019 and be able to extend the in-orbit life of a satellite. However, future designs call for these robotic units to be able to fix problems such as a stuck or non-deployed solar panels, and refuelling tasks.\nBerlusconi-owned Mediaset is seemingly exiting the pay-TV business, selling of its \u2018Premium\u2019 DTT subscription service to Vivendi. In essence the deal will take Mediaset back to a suite of commercial channels, and without the distraction of running a pay-TV business.\nThe deal sees Vivendi and Mediaset \u2018swap\u2019 3.5% stakes in each other\u2019s businesses, while both parties have signed a \u201cstrategic alliance\u201d agreement to develop content production and distribution for international markets and to create a global OTT platform. The suggestions are that the deal signals Vivendi\u2019s intention to play an expanded role in southern Europe (notably Italy and Spain) but also where it is gaining in strength via its Canal Plus channels internationally.\nThe satellite sector has had a torrid time lately, not helped by a lack of confidence with investors over Intelsat\u2019s position. Intelsat\u2019s troubled status \u2013 as far as the stock market is concerned \u2013 has also influenced the share positions at SES and Eutelsat.\nHowever, an examination of Eutelsat\u2019s prospects by the bank is not quite so positive. Berenberg says that Eutelsat is \u201cstructurally positive\u201d but its story \u201clacks catalysts\u201d and the bank admits it prefers SES which is helped by its upside potential from O3b.\nOn Feb 26 SES announced that its SES Platform Services (SPS) division would be acquiring Tel Aviv-based RR Media for about $242m ($13.29 a share). The agreement is expected to close during the next few months, and without presuming too much both RR Media boss Avi Cohen and SPS CEO Wilfried Urner are planning for the future of the unified business.\nSES, in its latest \u2018Satellite Monitor\u2019 report, says it has expanded its global reach by more than 5m homes over the past year to 317m homes globally. It now reaches 156m over Europe and where satellite holds onto its dominant position. Five years ago (in 2011) its overall reach was 258m homes.\nSES market & business analyst Ricardo Topham, in a London presentation on March 15, showed that while satellite and cable distribution remained fairly constant, there had been real growth in terms of IP-connected homes, and this growth was at the expense of terrestrial TV.\n\u201cWorldwide has gained 23% since 2011, representing the equivalent of adding a TV market the size of Poland every year,\u201d Topham says.\nThe opening day (Mar 7th) of the annual Satellite 2016 conference and exhibition in Washington DC had plenty of topics to cover. High amongst them was a thought-provoking 30-page report from equity analysts at Deutsche Bank and was issued late in the evening of Friday, March 4, and just ahead of the event.\nThe thrust of the report is that the glory days of FSS transmission might be coming to an end. Deutsch Bank\u2019s analyst Laurie Davison holds a downside view on satellite stocks in general, but he presents a compelling case in a very thorough overview of the sector.\nIndeed, the report doesn\u2019t make good reading for Paris-based Eutelsat (ETL). Davison reverses the bank\u2019s previous \u201cSELL\u201d guidance on Luxembourg\u2019s SES and now recommends investors to \u201cHOLD\u201d the stock, not least because the operator\u2019s share price has fallen some 30% this past year.\nTiVo, RR Media, Ofcom, Ultra HDTV.\nIntelsat\u2019s problems continue. Its Q4 and full-year numbers are both down on the same period last year. Q4 saw revenue of $571m ($619m, same period last year) and FY-2015 revenues were $2.353bn ($2.472). The operator\u2019s data, released Feb 22, saw management say that 2015\u2019s full year performance was much in line with previous guidance and the trends experienced during the year which saw pricing pressures in certain regions and continued reductions in US governmental spending, plus continued currency challenges from some markets, notably Brazil and Russia.\nSatellite operator Eutelsat has been hosting a series of meetings with equity analysts, and a recent comment from investment bankers Jefferies report on its session with the company\u2019s senior managers. Jefferies\u2019 equity analyst Giles Thorne reported to clients that Eutelsat\u2019s new-in-post CEO Rodolphe Belmer (he officially took over from Michel de Rosen on March 1st) provided a \u201crobust\u201d reiteration of the operator\u2019s growth plans for the next year or two.\nBut is there a \u2018Gorilla in the Room\u2019?\nParis-based satellite operator Eutelsat says it has reached a record total of 6004 channels on its fleet of satellites, and up 263 in the past year. HDTV penetration (757 channels) now stands at 12.6%. Eutelsat is carrying more than 2200 free-to-air channels, on 50 pay-TV platforms.

The second incarnation of Mint boasts smoke-colored walls, a glowing red ceiling and a sleek black bar where guests can enjoy a sake-based libation or watch sushi chef John Lu at work.\nMint Bistro owner Roi Shpindler said the restaurant\u2019s soft opening, held the last week of July, drew more customers than anticipated, leaving his staff to learn the food and drink menus under fire.\n\u201cAll in all, we\u2019ve got great feedback about this new menu,\u201d he said. As the size of the bar has been doubled in Mint part deux, two additional bartenders were hired on to the staff of 20. Shpindler has hired a second sushi chef to keep up with the demand.\nWhen Shpindler bought the building that now houses both the Bridge Cafe (which he opened five years ago) and Mint, the narrow dining room of the Bistro still had the look of the now defunct Baldwin\u2019s restaurant. He told himself he would keep Mint Bistro open for a year as it was, make money and then reopen it as the eatery he had always wanted it to be \u2014 a restaurant with a lounge-like feel that offered sushi and tapas and catered to young professionals.\nShpindler was only planning for a six- month renovation of the space \u2014 that was the estimate he was given by a contractor \u2014 but the doors remained closed for nearly nine months, as progress slowed.\nIn addition to the new dishes, the Mint menu will feature new prices that are \u201creasonable for today\u2019s economy,\u201d Shpindler said. \u201cFor customers that came in here before and saw our old high price points, a lot of those have been cut down to half,\u201d he said.\nShpindler will lead the charge in the kitchen \u2014 he also designed most of the menu \u2014 and cook alongside the bistro\u2019s new executive chef, Steven Shoemaker, and assistant head chef, Todd Somma. Lu, the restaurant\u2019s executive sushi chef, worked for 10 years behind New York sushi bars before relocating to the Granite State to work at Mint.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful presentation,\u201d Shpindler said of the wooden boats, complete with a mast and sails, that the sushi is served on. All sushi boats are also served with soup and salad, with the soup served in black and red bowls with wide-mouthed spoons.\nSushi hours will be extended until midnight at Mint Thursday through Saturday, when the restaurant is open until last call, Shpindler said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something light to eat so it goes along well with beer and wine \u2026 and the only place to go [and eat at that time] is the hot dog guy and the [Puritan] Backroom,\u201d Shpindler said.\nSushi also played a role in the development of Mint\u2019s new drink list as it now boasts a handful of sake-based drinks including the Japanese Sake Mojito and Sake Martini (Stoli vodka, house sake, Domaine de Canton and fresh lemon, garnished with candied ginger). Guests can also opt to order warm sake.\nAppetizers at the new 75-seat Mint include charred octopus carpaccio served with chickpeas, radish, shaved asparagus salad and celery-endive vinaigrette, forever braised short rib served with warm polenta flat bread, fava, gremolata and natural pan juices, and fire-roasted eggplant fritters battered with gluten-free tempura and served with house smoked mozzarella, lemon aioli and marinara sauce.\nAmong a handful of sandwich offerings are the Panini Medianoche (a classic Cuban with tender braised pork, sliced ham, manchego, mustard and pickle, served on a baguette) and the Croque Mint (speck prosciutto, gruyere, cranberry-mint b\u00e9chamel and fried egg).\nShpindler anticipates the Bistro\u2019s Potato Encrusted North Atlantic Cod (served with whipped cauliflower, sauteed spinach and a warm tomato chive vinaigrette) and the Lobster Ravioli (which sits in a lobster bisque and boasts a piece of Maine lobster tail on each pasta pouch) will be popular entrees.\nWhile he has not ruled it out completely, Shpindler said he is too busy at the Bridge Cafe to offer lunch at Mint anytime soon.\n\u201cI would rather have really great dinner service here,\u201d he said.", "version": "v0"}

You can quickly turn almost any website into an online store by pasting a few lines of HTML code onto a page, following instructions on the PayPal website.\nThe PayPal Standard cart doesn\u2019t give you accurate shipping calculated by the carriers, the ability to accept coupons, cart pages that look like part of your website, or a consistent checkout flow so you can track the effectiveness of your online advertising.

A hosted cart I\u2019ve tested is Ecwid*, which I think provides good features and a nice customer experience, at reasonable cost.\nIf your store needs more advanced features you can buy shopping cart software to install and maintain on your website. Our web store uses shopping cart software called Ecommerce Templates* that we installed on the shared Linux host that runs our site. This software gives us the features of other carts, plus unlimited logins with different permissions for our staff, support for drop shippers and affiliates, the option to collect and publish product reviews, more control over the cart appearance, extensive reporting, and so on.

More about this approach is discussed in part two of our article about how to set up your website.\nJust as with any other paid services, you should always set up and thoroughly test your shopping cart options before making a commitment.\nIt\u2019s also a good idea to treat websites that offer reviews and comparisons of different shopping carts with great suspicion, since I\u2019ve found that they often provide unreliable information.\nI\u2019ve tested several shopping carts that claim to make it easy to download every transaction into QuickBooks accounting software. I thought that the QuickBooks-integrated carts I tested were overpriced, difficult to use, and inferior to the alternatives in just about every other way.

The Order is contrary to a previous ruling by the Navajo Supreme Court2 and affirms that a tribal nation\u2019s exercise of civil jurisdiction over non-Indians must comport with federal law. In 1969, Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District (\u201cSRP\u201d) and the Navajo Nation executed a lease for an electric power plant, the Navajo Generating Station (\u201cNGS\u201d), located near Lake Powell in Arizona. In the lease, the Navajo Nation waived the power to \u201cdirectly or indirectly regulate or attempt to regulate the . . . operation of\u201d NGS. SRP agreed to give a preference in employment to Navajos. In 1985, the Navajo Nation enacted the Navajo Preference in Employment Act (\u201cNPEA\u201d), which requires just cause for termination and disallows other adverse employment actions. In 2004 and 2005, SRP fired two employees, and each alleged that termination was without just cause, thus in violation of the NPEA. The issues in both the federal and Navajo courts was whether the NPEA applied to NGS, and whether the Navajo Nation had waived the right to regulate employment at NGS.\nIn 2007, the Navajo Supreme Court ruled that the waiver of regulation of NGS\u2019s \u201coperation\u201d did not unmistakably include a waiver of employment, and also that the Navajo Council could not waive the right to regulate employment under Navajo Traditional Law. The Arizona District Court disagreed. \u201cOperation\u201d inherently includes employment because employment is part of operations, or how NGS works. Moreover, the Navajo Council has the authority to waive sovereign powers of the Navajo Nation, as the elected governing body of the Nation.3 Before reaching these issues, the Arizona District Court determined that the issues to be decided were part of a federal question \u2013 whether application of the NPEA to a non-Indian employer was an \u201congoing violation of federal law.\u201d To do so, the Court resolved several technical issues, such as joinder of the Navajo Nation, the scope of the wavier of sovereign immunity for suit against tribal officials under the doctrine of Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 138 (1908), and whether interpretation of the 1969 lease implicated federal law.\nThe Significance of SRP v. Lee: The case reflects two important principles. First, a tribal nation may waive sovereign powers, as a state or the federal government may, through an unmistakable waiver. Second, whether the tribal nation has waived a sovereign power is a matter of federal law. However, businesses should note the Salt River issues have been litigated for about eight years, with decisions by the Navajo Supreme Court and two by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\nThe Take Away: A business negotiating a contract with a tribal nation may pursue waiver of sovereign powers, including regulation of employment. We believe a carefully crafted dispute resolution clause, including a waiver of tribal proceedings, may allow prompter enforcement of waivers in federal court.\n1.

Use this form and we\u2019ll add your contributions to the 50th Anniversary timeline.\nEven before there was a Department of Theatre, theatrical productions were an important part of the fledgling Victoria College, an affiliate of McGill University and the earliest iteration of the University of Victoria. Located on the Lansdowne Campus (now the home of Camosun College), Victoria College hosted the Players\u2019 Club, which actively produced plays in the Young Building Auditorium. Professor Roger Bishop, the Chair of the Department of English, directed many of these plays.\nIn 1963, Victoria College became the University of Victoria, an autonomous, full degree-granting institution. Its increasing size necessitated a new home, so the university began to transfer courses to buildings located on the new Gordon Head campus.\nRight from its first year, the University of Victoria offered a course in Theatre through the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. By the next year, one course grew into four. These courses were offered by the English department. Roger Bishop approached Carl Hare, a young English professor with an interest in theatre who would later become the Director of Theatre, and shared his idea of creating a fully realized theatre program. The initial plan was that Hare would teach many of the theatre classes as well as direct and perform in some of the early productions.\nCharged with the development of a theatre curriculum and the promise of two army huts, Carl Hare began transforming the small, square buildings on the Gordon Head campus that had been erected as a military base into the first Phoenix Theatre. With only $12,500 \u2013 much of it fundraised from the Victoria College Players Club \u2013 he mobilized volunteers, faculty, and students to start work on what would become a tiny eighty-seat theatre.\nThe Phoenix Theatre was fashioned by erecting a concrete building to fit between two long huts. As well as the department\u2019s performance space, the resulting building served as a multi-purpose classroom. The department\u2019s offices and scene shops operated out of one of the huts while classes were held in another. Students constantly had to run back and forth between them \u2013 from \u201cL\u201d Hut to \u201cM\u201d Hut to \u201cR\u201d Hut, crossing over McKenzie Avenue many times a day.\nThe theatre space contained a simple stage and a control booth, but no wing space or fly tower. Nevertheless, it was \u2013 and still is \u2013 regarded fondly as a creative venue. The name \u2013 the Phoenix Theatre \u2013 was a fitting moniker for a building that rose from the remnants of the old military hospital, morgue, and chapel.\nOne of the students who helped to build this Phoenix Theatre was Michael Whitfield, now an internationally acclaimed lighting designer with a thirty-five-year career with the Stratford Festival and other prestigious theatres around the world. Whitfield was present in the summer of 1964 when the Department of English began producing plays through a \u201ctown and gown\u201d initiative called the Campus Players, which brought students, faculty and local actors together to stage productions. To celebrate the quadrennial of Shakespeare\u2019s birth, they presented Shakespeare \u201964, a festival featuring productions of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, The Alchemist and Richard III at the Young Building Auditorium on Lansdowne campus.\n\u201cThe Campus Players were remarkable because you\u2019d frequently be working alongside your professors in a completely different environment,\u201d says Whitfield, who returned to UVic to teach as a sessional instructor since retiring from Stratford.\nBy the summer of 1965, the newly opened Phoenix Theatre hosted a Renaissance Festival, featuring Twelfth Night and A Man For All Seasons.\nWith the new theatre space created and several production successes in hand, the Department of English expanded its number of theatre courses and created a Division of Theatre in 1965. Students could now earn a BA with a Major in Theatre.\nAs early as April of 1964, the University Senate began to assess all Fine Arts offerings on campus. A Curriculum Committee completed a comprehensive study by December, which recommended the establishment of a distinctive School of Fine Arts for the study of the theory, history, and practice of the arts. The UVic Senate formally tabled this recommendation in April of 1965.\nBeginning in the fall of 1967, UVic had one of Canada\u2019s first integrated Schools of Fine Arts, with Divisions in Theatre, Music, and Art and Art History. Instead of acquiring a BA, the students earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts. Only two years later, in 1969, the School of Fine Arts developed into the Faculty of Fine Arts, and the divisions became the Departments of Theatre, Art History, Studio Visual Arts, and Music.\nIn the Department of Theatre, specializations in Acting, Design, Directing, and Developmental Drama (later called Theatre-in-Education and now referred to as Applied Theatre) were offered along with Masters level programs. Ralph Allen, who arrived to teach in 1968, was named the department\u2019s first full Chair and over the next few years, he would recruit many new faculty and staff who would have a lasting impact on the department. Among these early recruits were John Krich, who joined the department to teach acting in 1969 and introduced many new initiatives before retiring in 2002, and Harvey Miller who arrived in 1970 and taught directing until 2002.\nThe new Faculty of Fine Arts quickly established itself as a leader in the local arts community by launching Victoria Fair, an adventurous, Victoria-wide cultural event that was rich with theatre, music, lectures, and art exhibitions. Held each summer from 1969 to 1971, the festival centered around three plays mounted by the Department of Theatre that ran in repertoire, usually at the McPherson Playhouse in downtown Victoria. Victoria Fair featured professional theatre artists from across Canada and the US, including Christopher Newton (later the Artistic Director at Shaw Festival), Marti Maraden (later the Co-Artistic Director at Stratford and Artistic Director at the National Arts Centre) and Neil Munro (later a Resident Director at Shaw). These artists worked closely with UVic faculty, staff, and students, as well as theatre artists from the Victoria community. Other local arts organizations also participated, and Victoria Fair included concerts by the Victoria Conservatory of Music and children\u2019s theatre presentations by the Bastion Theatre Co. Victoria Fair also featured play-related lectures, and numerous concerts and recitals, presented on campus throughout the summer. The 1970 fair saw the world premieres of two commissioned works and special exhibitions at the university\u2019s Maltwood Museum.\nVictoria Fair was also an early indicator of how closely the Department of Theatre would influence and become intertwined with Victoria\u2019s local theatre community. This initiative to reach out to the community was also extended to high school students from across BC. Over various summers, as early as 1966 and running until 1983, the Department of Theatre hosted Senior Secondary Summer Theatre Workshops (known as the SSSTW). Each summer a selected group of high school students from across BC and other provinces enrolled in theatre studies that culminated in a fully mounted production on the Phoenix stage under the guidance of a guest director. Many of these high school students elected to continue their theatre studies at the University of Victoria.\nThe growing department would receive nation-wide recognition when it participated in the national Dominion Drama Festivals, including accolades for their 1971 festival presentation of Justice Not Revenge in Ottawa and their 1973 presentation of The Threepenny Opera in St. John\u2019s, Newfoundland.\nSpearheaded by Professor John Krich \u2013 and running for twenty-six years \u2013 the Department of Theatre began producing Phoenix Summer Theatre (PST) in 1972. PST was designed to provide an intensive, realistic repertory experience for theatre students outside the school year. It was supported by the UVic\u2019s Summer Session office as well as a grant from the federal Opportunities For Youth program, which paid the students around fifty dollars a week. Throughout its existence, a wide variety of work, from plays and musicals to dance and spoken word was produced. In 1985, after the new Phoenix Building and the Faculty Club (now called the University Club) were constructed, the two groups began working collaboratively to offer Barbeque Theatre, an outdoor dinner theatre presentation. Many memorable performances were staged here using the trees, shrubbery and even the actual pond that surrounds the Club\u2019s patio as part of the scenery for plays like Shakespeare\u2019s As You Like It; Agatha Christie\u2019s Murder On The Nile; Noel Coward\u2019s Hayfever; and a spectacular production of J.M. Barrie\u2019s Peter Pan (that was filmed and broadcast on CHEK TV). Peter Pan featured actors magically flying through the trees and a mechanical crocodile swimming in the pond!\nDuring this productive period, many influential faculty members and staff arrived who would shape the future of the department. In 1971, the renowned Theatre-in-Education pioneer Barbara McIntyre came to UVic and was named the Department Chair in 1972 after Ralph Allen\u2019s departure. In the same year, lighting designer Giles Hogya and movement instructor Kazimierz Piesowocki joined the department. Hogya was the Chair of the Department from 1995 to1998 and served as Dean of the Faculty of Fine Arts from 1998 to 2007. Piesowocki influenced generations of theatre students over his twenty-five years at the Phoenix and often returned as a guest artist after he retired in 1998. Staff member Bindon Kinghorn arrived in 1973 to be the chief carpenter and as well as teaching stage management and directing plays, and would become the Theatre Manager for many years before retiring in 2013. William D. West, the noted local artist, became a design professor in 1974 and stayed until retiring in 1985. West had already contributed to UVic\u2019s new campus in 1965 when he created the mobile sculpture for the north stairwell of the Clearihue Building. Later, for the university\u2019s 15th anniversary, he was asked to design UVic\u2019s official flag. At the Phoenix he also designed and created the Coast Salish basket weave mural at the entrance of the current Chief Dan George Theatre. Linda Hardy, the department\u2019s current and much-loved voice instructor, acting professor, and director, arrived at the department in 1975.\nWith an increased faculty and growing student body all working to produce a full season of shows during the school year, plus running a repertory company during the summer, the department was expanding at a prodigious rate and it quickly outgrew its home in the old military huts.\nAt the close of the 1970s a new wave of excitement swept through the Department of Theatre as it was announced that, with the support of President Howard Petch, the UVic Board of Governors, and the Universities Council of BC, a new theatre facility would be constructed on campus. A site on the west side of campus was chosen and a committee was struck to research examples of other university theatre facilities. Throughout the design period of the new building, theatre faculty, staff and students were engaged in the planning process, with particular input from Carl Hare and design professor William West.\nThe Department of Theatre flourished in its new surroundings and with the new Phoenix Building came opportunities to profile UVic\u2019s beautiful theatre facilities on a national level. The first spring after the official opening in 1982, the department welcomed the International Children\u2019s Theatre Festival. Theatre companies from around the world presented a variety of dance, music, puppetry, and theatrical productions over four days on the Phoenix stages.\nA collaboration between the Department of Theatre and the Department of Writing in 1984 saw the launch of the Futurewrights. This program provided opportunities for theatre students to direct new plays by writing students in the Phoenix performance spaces. This initiative evolved over the years and was later called Phoenix Plays, then the Festival of Innovative New Drama Series, and finally the Studio Series.\nIn 1991, the Department of Theatre celebrated its 25th anniversary. Dubbed the Silver Phoenix Celebrations and organized with the immeasurable help of Katherine Edwards, the department\u2019s long-time secretary, the reunion brought over 125 former students, graduates, faculty, and staff to the campus for a weekend in late August. Inside the building, the Phoenix was transformed into a museum of memories, featuring displays of costumes, props, scenery, photographs, programs, and other ephemera from the past. Over the weekend, former classmates, faculty, and staff reunited and reminisced at a dinner and dance, a brunch, a barbeque and an unforgettable game of croquet/mini golf that took participants across the old parking lot that is now occupied by the Visual Arts building.\nThat same year, several students (led by David McPherson and Ian Case) approached the faculty with an idea: the creation of an independent theatre company run by current students, for students, with the support of the department. The Student Alternative Theatre Company (SATCo) was born. Tim Sutherland coordinated the first season, which set the standard for years to come. Any short, one-act play, whether written by an established playwright or a current student, could be submitted for the consideration of the SATCo committee. Each week, student writers and/or directors, designers, and actors would develop, rehearse, and present their work for the department over short three-day runs. Many interesting projects came out of this independent experimental process, including the first-run of many plays (like Atomic Vaudeville\u2019s Legoland) that would later be remounted at the Fringe Festivals or presented by other theatre companies. Many relationships forged during SATCo productions evolved in to small independent theatre companies after graduation, among them Theatre SKAM, ITSAZOO Productions, and SNAFU Dance Theatre. As the department celebrates its 50th anniversary in 2016, SATCo in turn celebrates twenty-five years of making theatre by students, for students.\nIn 1994, Theatre-in-Education professor Juliana Saxton and Faculty of Education professor Carole Miller (also the wife of directing professor Harvey Miller) worked together to host the first National Canadian Tertiary Drama Educators Symposium at Dunsmuir Lodge. The papers submitted to this symposium later were edited and published as Canadian Drama Education: The State of Our Art. This gathering laid the foundation for the second International Drama in Education Research Institute in 1997, which brought over 100 delegates from fourteen countries to UVic\u2019s campus. To this day, the Department of Theatre\u2019s Applied Theatre professors work collaboratively with the Faculty of Education professors to invite noted practitioners to the annual Summer Drama Institute for the benefit of students in both areas.\nThe Department of Theatre hosted the International Beckett Festival in May of 1996. Theatre companies and distinguished scholars from around the world came together to celebrate the life and work of the playwright, novelist, poet and theatre director Samuel Beckett. Over twenty academic papers were presented and twenty-one plays were performed by theatre groups, including the Goetheanum-Buhne from Switzerland, the Pantechnicon Theatre Co. from California, and the Jean Cocteau Repertory Co. from New York. A highlight of the festival was a special appearance by Fred Neumann, co-Artistic Director of the Mabou Mines Theatre Co. in New York, who was considered to be the pre-eminent interpreter of the works of Samuel Beckett. Neumann performed Worstward Ho, a work that Beckett himself had given to Neumann during their long professional relationship.\nDuring this period, Carl Hare became the Department Chair from 1982-1984, before leaving to take a position in another university. Following his departure, Barbara McIntyre returned as Acting Chair until the renowned British theatre historian, Michael Booth, was selected as the new Chair during an international search. Over his ten years in the position, Booth was instrumental in working with long-time theatre history faculty member Alan Hughes to usher in a Theatre History PhD program..\nAs the 1990s came to a close, so did some long-time Phoenix traditions. After twenty-five years of incredible success, the Phoenix Summer Theatre program came to an end following the 1998 production of Nunsense.\nThe years around the new millennium saw the Department of Theatre\u2019s faculty expand yet again. With Michael Booth retiring, Jennifer Wise, a respected scholar, was selected to teach theatre history. Internationally distinguished theatre designer Mary Kerr was hired to head up the department\u2019s costume design area, and professional actor Jan Wood was first contracted as an Artist-in-Residence before later joining the faculty.\nWith Giles Hogya promoted from Department Chair to Dean of Fine Arts in 1998, the department struggled to fill this position until 2001, when Brian Richmond, a Canadian director and founder of the Persephone Theatre, was invited to become the new Chair. With new marketing materials in 2002 \u2013 including the bright red awning over the entrance \u2013 the department launched another enduring program, the Spotlight on Alumni. First introduced in 2003 with TJ Dawes\u2019 The Slipknot, this program invited theatre graduates back to their Alma Mater to be part of the Phoenix Mainstage Season. Thus began over a decade of incredible performances that not only highlighted the success of theatre graduates, but in the process gave current students an opportunity to be mentored by professional artists. Continuing to this day, the Spotlight program has been expanded into a three-week Alumni Festival for the 50th anniversary season.\nFrom 2005 to 2008, the Faculty of Fine Arts entered into a cultural exchange with the Universidad of Veracruzana in Xalapa, Mexico. Dean Giles Hogya, Theatre Manager Bindon Kinghorn, and several other Fine Arts faculty members travelled to Xalapa in 2006 to study Spanish and participate in the Drama Department there. In 2006, Mexican visual artist Jos\u00e9 Manuel Morelos Villegas designed the play posters for the 2006-2007 Phoenix season and Mexican director Mart\u00edn Zapata came to Victoria to direct his play El ins\u00f3lito caso del se\u00f1or Morton (The Unusual Case of Mr. Morton) in 2008.\nIn November 2009, the department participated in an interdisciplinary project with the Department of Physics and Astronomy during the International Year of Astronomy with the first staged reading of Moons of Jupiter, a new play by Professor Jennifer Wise about Galileo and his daughters. Another interdisciplinary project saw the department collaborate with the Department of Germanic Studies in 2011 on a cross-listed course that culminated in a staged reading of Woyzeck in German. The performance drew many audience members from both the university and the local German community.\nTo celebrate the 50th anniversary of the University of Victoria, UVic was the host of the 2013 Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences. This huge campus-wide event included the annual Canadian Association for Theatre Research (CATR) Conference held here at the Phoenix Theatre. The conference saw the return of many alumni who are now working at universities and in various academic roles across Canada. During the conference, the CATR honoured Professor Juliana Saxton as well as Dr. Ann Saddlemyer, the founding president of the association who was a faculty member in the Department of English when Theatre courses at UVic were first offered.\nIn 2015, the Department of Theatre hosted the first national symposium on actor training, initiated by movement professor Conrad Alexandrowicz. Entitled \u201cActor Training in a Shifting World,\u201d the symposium brought thirty-four acting instructors from post-secondary institutions across Canada to discuss the state of their field and to share ideas about the future of actor training in Canada.\nDuring the last decade, the department has continued to grow and change. In 2006, the internationally respected English Applied Theatre practitioner, Warwick Dobson came to the department as the University Scholar in Applied Theatre. In 2008, Dobson succeeded Brian Richmond as the Department Chair. Other new faculty members included Fine Arts Dean and theatre historian Sarah Blackstone, movement professor Conrad Alexandrowicz, returning alumni Peter McGuire and Anthony Vickery, actor and director Fran Gebhard, and theatre and dance historian Allana Lindgren, who was named to the position of Department Chair in 2014. In 2015, the department\u2019s Applied Theatre program expanded and gained an additional faculty member, Kirsten Sadeghi-Yekta.\nDuring the past decade, the thirty-five-year-old Phoenix Building has also undergone renovations and rejuvenations. With the replacement of the dimmer system, lighting instruments, and operating boards, new rigging, new house curtains, and an extensive replacement and upgrade of the theatre sound systems, this much loved facility maintains its state-of-the-art status.\nIn 1994, Law faculty member Bill Neilson proposed a cultural exchange between UVic and the prestigious Chulalongkorn University in Thailand. Linda Hardy was asked to be one of the first to participate in a faculty exchange, and in 1995 she worked with Chulalongkorn faculty to direct Shakespeare\u2019s A Midsummer Nights\u2019 Dream, translated into Thai and placed into a contemporary Thai setting.\nThis initiative helped lay the foundation for a new student-based relationship with the Bangkok University\u2019s Performing Arts Department. Spearheaded by design professor Allan Stichbury in 2013, this global exchange program has seen six UVic theatre students travel to Bangkok to study design, production and management, or applied theatre for one term. The first Thai exchange student arrived to study at UVic in the spring of 2016.\nIn 2014, the Department of Theatre initiated its first field school program, organized by Applied Theatre professor Warwick Dobson. Led by PhD candidate Matthew Gusul as part of his applied theatre thesis research, thirteen theatre students traveled to Tamil Nadu and Pondicherr, India, to participate in a two-month project bringing together elders from the Tamaraikulam Elder\u2019s Village and young students of the Isha Vidhya Matriculation School. Students worked with both groups to share stories and help develop an intergenerational theatre company.\nThese global initiatives have also lead to a rise in international students arriving for our undergraduate, and especially graduate programs, to be mentored by the world-class faculty at the Department of Theatre. With students arriving from the Philippines, Thailand, Nigeria, China, Australia, South Africa, Argentina, and the United States, this international scope of experiences has been a positive influence on the theatre research and practices for all Phoenix students.\nAs the Department of Theatre looks to its next fifty years, we are eager to continue to educate new generations of theatre artists, and to shape the landscape of theatre in our own community, across Canada, and the world.\nA special thank-you to John Krich, Jen Wise, Michael Whitfield, and Allana Lindgren for their assistance in assembling this comprehensive history of the Phoenix Theatre and Department of Theatre.", "version": "v0"}

No matter if you are a new user or an experienced one, Pinterest holds so many great things to discover.\nThis is probably the easiest way to find others that share your passions. On the top of the site, you will find several links, including Categories. Simply hover over this link and you will be presented with over 30 great areas to enjoy. You\u2019ll find sports, science and nature, travel, history, holidays, art, humor, foods, and more. No matter what you love, you can find it\u2019s category quickly and start navigating over to narrow down your search.\nOne of the things that makes Pinterest extremely easy to use is that once you navigate to your favorite category, you are instantly shown tons of great photos, ideas, how to\u2019s, and more that revolve around that category. For example, if you pick travel, you\u2019ll find pictures, maps, sales, and beautiful art work that revolve around every corner of the world. You will find some new places that you\u2019ll want to visit on your next vacation.\nIn this area of the site, you will see a bit of everything except that it only adds in posts in areas that are really hot at the moment. You will find things like music, foods, art, movies, and more \u2013 anything that lots of people are talking about on Pinterest, you\u2019ll find here. Sometimes, it\u2019s fun just to click on the Popular link and just watch the feed that goes on here. You never really know what the site might post here, and it\u2019s always fun to see what other people around the world are talking about.\nYou can also find new ideas, new interests, and new things to get involved in here in the Popular area of Pinterest. Craft ideas, art work, areas to travel, new music, foods to try, and even some cool educational items can pop up here. You can easily learn all about that new punk rock band from across the pond or learn how to decoupage \u2013 you never know what you\u2019re going to find.\nOf course, if you\u2019re just ready to see what everyone is posting all the time, you can always watch the Everything feed. This feed will show you posts from every category, so there will always be a jumble of great things to check out. The feed runs off of people you are following as well as those following you, and you will find some from plenty of other users around the world here too.\nEverything holds so much, that it can get overwhelming if you are looking for one particular thing. However, if you\u2019re just looking for one category, one hobby, you should narrow it down to the Categories area that we talked about first.\nAs you use the site more, you\u2019ll find your own way to navigate to the things that you like the most. You will start to follow different people that love the same things you love, and people will follow you as well. It\u2019s not only a great way to connect with people around the world, but it\u2019s also a way to bring people together that are passionate about the same things.\nNo matter how long you have used the site, there is always something new to see, someone new to follow, and there are no limits on followers or posts either. Unlike other social media sites, there are no limits to what you can do and share with people around the world.

Just what we need right now. In the interest of bringing light and not heat to the latest spat between the \u201cklai kodesh\u201d and the Israeli supremes, a little historical context might be helpful. The uneasy meeting of minds between the Chazon Ish and Ben Gurion back when the State was very young, produced a reality that became known as \u201cthe Status Quo\u201d. This ill advised agreement basically created a way for the non-Zionist community to gain some advantages from the State without having any responsibility for it. Why did Ben Gurion agree to this? Avi Ravitzky claims that BG thought the Hareidi community would ultimately disappear and the problem would solve itself. The defection to Zionism from the young of the old Yishuv gave credence to this perspective, but alas, it was not to be.\nFor years Aguda, unlike Neturei Karta, has been allowed to declare that the cow (the State) is treif, but the milk is kosher. Now, sixty years later, an unsympathetic Supreme Court wants to treat this fifth column as if they have to adhere to criteria that have heretofore never been the interest of the State. The Hareidim have always had an independent educational system supported by the State. The Supreme Court presumably could have saved everyone the trouble and could have chosen not to hear this complaint. The Sefardim were happy to have their own school, but instead, the Supremes decided that it was high time to address the inequity of the status quo only to create social upheaval for the State at a critical time (it always seems to be a critical time). It looks like the Supremes have lost and have only succeeded in confirming the worst suspicions of a profoundly ambivalent community.\nThe hyper-clannishness of Chasidic communities can certainly be seen as non-inclusive, and is often racially motivated by many of their members, but the clash of cultures and perceived threat to the Chasidic way of life is not necessarily racist even though it is exclusive. Just as rejecting inter-marriage is exclusive but not necessarily motivated by bigotry.\nThe major public disaffection with the Hareidi community is their exemption from the army. That should be the issue that is worthy of a supreme court battle\u2013how they choose to educate and with whom should not be the interest of the State and this is one spat that could have been easily avoided.\nOf course this could easily have been avoided. They did not wish to avoid it. It is not true that the State has no interest in how they choose to educate. In fact, I don\u2019t think its a stretch to say that this is perhaps the most compelling state interest. If they were taught in school that the Israeli Government was a legitimate source of authority it would be very different place. Rather than seeing this as a useless waste of time and effort, we should look at it instead as the first shot in a long war. There will be many others including military service before long. A state cannot survive when large sections of the society are indifferent or even hostile. Israel is reaching a tipping point and the non-haredi majority will want to use its power to address this now.", "version": "v0"}

In a new study, Owen Thompson (University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee) examined the impact of Head Start on a variety of socioeconomic outcomes for participants through age 48.\nOur understanding of the age at which the black\u2013white test gap emerges has been hampered by two overlooked factors. Timothy N. Bond (Purdue University) and Kevin Lang (Boston University) address these issues in a forthcoming paper in the Journal of Human Resources.\nThe choice of college major can have big implications for students\u2019 long-term outcomes, such as lifetime earnings, but researchers have limited evidence on what helps shape this decision. New research by Christopher Avery (Harvard University), Oded Gurantz (Stanford University, College Board), Michael Hurwitz (College Board), and Jonathan Smith (Georgia State University) examined how Advanced Placement (AP), a national program that exposes high school students to a college-level curriculum, shapes students\u2019 choice of college major.\nResearchers\u2014and parents of teenagers\u2014have long suspected that school starts too early in the morning for adolescents. New research by Jenni Heissel (Naval Postgraduate Academy) and Sam Norris (Northwestern University) shows exactly how much early start times are hindering academic achievement.\nThe use of school accountability systems is becoming increasingly popular as a way of changing school behavior to improve school performance. School accountability systems can be divided into two broad categories: soft and hard accountability systems. Soft accountability systems provide information about school performance to parents, students, and the schools themselves, which can influence school behavior. Hard accountability systems tie rewards and punishments to school performance, directly affecting incentives faced by schools. A new study looks at the effect of releasing information about school performance on future performance.\nA myriad of studies find that later-born children have worse educational and labor market outcomes as adults than their older siblings, a phenomenon known as the \u201cbirth order effect.\u201d New research finds these differences begin very early in children\u2019s lives\u2014and parenting behavior can explain it.\nSocial Security provides a large portion of household income in old age. Most women receive at least some Social Security benefits over their lifetime based upon their husbands\u2019 work record, and this will continue even as women are more attached to the labor market and receive higher wages. Unfortunately for many wives, the age her husband begins receiving Social Security benefits can have a spillover effect and also impact her lifetime benefits.\nThe role of psychological attributes such as hope and self-efficacy in escaping poverty has attracted increasing attention among economists, policy-makers, and development practitioners.

Baltimore\u2019s violent crime rate has been trending in the wrong direction for years, and is a constant source of concern for residents, visitors and those who conduct regular business in the city. Putting all the embarrassing national news headlines aside, the bottom line is that people just don\u2019t feel safe in Baltimore. While the Governor has shown discretion by not outwardly blaming the city\u2019s leadership, it\u2019s clear from his actions that he has no faith the local government can do what it takes to reverse this disturbing trend. The city\u2019s leadership does not even appear to be directly involved with the creation or implementation of these new initiatives, which include the formation of violent crime joint operations center downtown.\nThe joint operations center will serve as home base for upwards of 200 new law enforcement officers from sixteen agencies and seven law enforcement task forces such as the FBI, DEA, ATF and the U.S. Marshals. The Baltimore Police and the State\u2019s Attoney\u2019s Office will also have a presence in the center, in addition to a special operations unit of the Maryland State Police. With all these new law enforcement officers pounding the pavement there will certainly be hundreds of new cases to prosecute, but if you think the Governor simply planned to hand all these cases over to the local prosecutor then think again. The Governor wants many of these cases to be handled in federal court, and is doing so by expanding the reach of Project Exile, a program where city gun crime offenders are prosecuted in federally. The feds are not footing the entire bill for the increased workload, as the Governor actually pledged state money for the sole purpose of hiring more federal prosecutors to prosecute violent crime in the city. Federal sentencing guidelines are harsher with respect to violent offenses and crimes involving firearms, and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office is notorious for high conviction rates. A defendant is far more likely to serve significant prison time in the federal system due to mandatory sentences and no parole.\nThe governor also announced greater funding for victim and witness relocation programs, which will increase the likelihood that state and federal prosecutors will have their witnesses ready and available when it comes time for trial. Violent crime cases are routinely dismissed due to witness unavailability, and this has become a major issue in Baltimore City for state and federal prosecutors alike. Another announcement from last week was the introduction of the Repeat Firearms Offenders Act of 2019, which will double the minimum mandatory prison sentence from 5 years to 10 for those convicted of felon in possession of a firearm. This law was modified a few years ago to make the mandatory sentence discretionary if the disqualifying crime and any punishment (including probation) ended more than 5 years prior to the new incident date. The effectiveness of mandatory minimum sentences is arguable, but politicians love them so they\u2019re here to stay.\nFinally, the Governor announced the Judicial Transparency Act of 2019, which will set out to publish the violent crime sentences of every judge across the state. This is not a topic we want to simply graze over, so look out for a follow-up article on this potential law in the next couple of months.

The sale process functioned imperfectly as a price discovery tool, both during the pre-signing and post-signing phases. Its structure and result are sufficiently credible to exclude an outlier valuation for the Company like the one the petitioners advanced, but sufficient pricing anomalies and dis-incentives to bid existed to create the possibility that the sale process permitted an undervaluation of several dollars per share. Financial sponsors using an LBO model could not have bid close to $18 per share because of their IRR requirements and the Company's inability to support the necessary levels of leverage. Assuming the $17.62 figure is right, then a strategic acquirer that perceived the Company\u2018s value could have gotten the Company for what was approximately a 25% discount.", "version": "v0"}

Waddell is a good writer, and a respected authority in the field (and he continued publishing well into the 2000s).\nBecause there is increasing concern about low-back disability and its current medical management, this analysis attempts to construct a new theoretic framework for treatment. Observations of natural history and epidemiology suggest that low-back pain should be a benign, self-limiting condition, that low back-disability as opposed to pain is a relatively recent Western epidemic, and that the role of medicine in that epidemic must be critically examined. The traditional medical model of disease is contrasted with a biopsychosocial model of illness to analyze success and failure in low-back disorders. Studies of the mathematical relationship between the elements of illness in chronic low-back pain suggest that the biopsychosocial concept can be used as an operational model that explains many clinical observations. This model is used to compare rest and active rehabilitation for low-back pain. Rest is the commonest treatment prescribed after analgesics but is based on a doubtful rationale, and there is little evidence of any lasting benefit. There is, however, little doubt about the harmful effects \u2014 especially of prolonged bed rest. Conversely, there is no evidence that activity is harmful and, contrary to common belief, it does not necessarily make the pain worse. Experimental studies clearly show that controlled exercises not only restore function, reduce distress and illness behavior, and promote return to work, but actually reduce pain. Clinical studies confirm the value of active rehabilitation in practice. To achieve the goal of treating patients rather than spines, we must approach low-back disability as an illness rather than low-back pain as a purely physical disease. We must distinguish pain as a purely the symptoms and signs of distress and illness behavior from those of physical disease, and nominal from substantive diagnoses. Management must change from a negative philosophy of rest for pain to more active restoration of function. Only a new model and understanding of illness by physicians and patients alike makes real change possible.", "version": "v0"}

That\u2019s me screaming. Yes, it is that exciting!\nHowever, as excited as I am by their love affair, the way that the world\u2019s media have been carrying on since they announced their engagement, you\u2019d think they were the ONLY lovebirds tying the knot tomorrow.\nAnd so this is why, I\u2019ve been on a global hunt for other awesome couples who will also be getting married on the same day as Harry and Meghan, this Saturday 19th May, those who also deserve to have their big day bigged up and cheered on! And just because one couple are truly Royal, it doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t other couples out there who are royal in their own lovely, special way.\nSo do join me in celebrating all the royal couples out there, who\u2019ll be getting hitched on this special, historic day, including this glorious bunch below who have kindly shared their wedding stories.\nRuth and Simon have been together for four years and met via a mutual friend in a pub. Their wedding is taken place in a village hall near Hastings, and to really get into the swing of it, they\u2019re having a royal theme. Awesome, right?\nAnd if they couldn\u2019t get any more royal, their names after their wedding will be Mr and Mrs King. Isn\u2019t that superb!\nAll rise for the Kings.\nJenna and Garrett\u2019s love story just cannot get any cuter. They met at a college bus stop, when Jenna\u2019s umbrella caused rain to drip all over Garrett. Isn\u2019t that the cutest? Like a love scene straight out of a film. And now four years later, they get to celebrate their love with a beautiful ceremony and wedding in Forsyth Park, Savannah, Georgia.\nWith their Officiant Tracy Brisson of Savannah Custom Weddings, they have planned a stunning and intimate ceremony. They\u2019ve written their own personal vows, and will have a violinist play music throughout their ceremony and they\u2019ll be carrying out a tree-planting ceremony too. How wonderful! And these guys are super excited too, as their wedding is a destination wedding for them, as they\u2019re travelling from West Virginia for their big day in Savannah.\nJenna and Garrett were also keen to point out that they choose May 19th before Harry and Meghan, so it is in fact Harry and Meghan who is marrying on Jenna and Garrett\u2019s wedding day and not the other way around!\nThis music-loving pair met at a music gig two and a half years ago. For their wedding, which they always wanted to be held in Spring, they\u2019re holding it in a village hall in rural Leicestershire. They\u2019re having a 1940s theme with a Goth twist and Stuart\u2019s band \u2013 FIRST WAVE \u2013 will be playing, too!\nFor their ceremony, which will be led by Celebrant Helen Walter from Shires Ceremonies, they\u2019ll be saying their own personal vows and lighting a unity candle.\nsweethearts. For their big day and celebration of love, they\u2019ll be celebrating their marriage at the stunning Chateau de Lartigolle in Pessan, France \u2013 a venue they fell in love with at first site. Their intimate and bespoke ceremony will be led by Celebrant Diane Smith, from SW France Celebrant.\nAnd this lovely pair are pretty excited to be sharing their wedding date with the Royals, as our their friends and family.\nEmily and Sean met back in 2012 through friends at The Great British Beer Festival in London and they\u2019re having their wedding in stunning Polzeath, Cornwall. Their fabulous ceremony led by Denise Whitehair of Cornish Celebrants, will be on the beach. They\u2019re writing their own vows, having friends and family do two readings (one from Bob Marley, one from The Hobbit), and finishing with a Cornish well wishing. Sounds amazing, right?\nAnd although Emily and Sean are excited about sharing their wedding date with Harry and Meghan, they do think something fishy is going on with those Royals.\nYes, that does sound very fishy, indeed!\nIrish couple, Nicola and Martin have been together for ten years and were only engaged for a short time before setting their May date.\nNicola and Martin have a fab ceremony in store at Clonabreany House in Kells, Co. Meath, which will be led by their wedding Celebrant Yvonne Cassidy. They\u2019ll be choosing their own vows and Yvonne will perform a blessing of the hands, and their bridesmaid, Amy, will be singing a song for them during the ceremony. How lovely is that? And Nicola and Martin are also thrilled that their children, Lily and Harry, will also get to be a big part of their special day, too and they can\u2019t wait for them to be involved.\nSomeone get me some tissues, please.\nJo and Will are our second couple to have met at a beer festival! They met in October 2011 through mutual friends at the Robin Hood beer festival! They\u2019re tying the knot in Cambridge and have got what sounds like an awesome ceremony awaiting them. Led by Celebrant Michelle Taylor, Jo\u2019s Mum and Grandma will be walking in first, followed by bridesmaids, then Jo and her Dad will walk in to \u2018You Are My Sunshine,\u2019 which is a very special song to Jo and her family. They\u2019ll also be having personal vows, some readings from friends and lighting candles.\nWhen asked about sharing their wedding with Megs and Haz, this couple weren\u2019t too fussed.\nNow if there was an award for originality of a wedding venue then it would most certainly have to go to Gail and Theodore who, wait for it \u2013 are getting married in a football stadium. Yup, you read that right. Their ceremony is being held on top of the Florida State University football stadium overlooking the field because Gail and Theodore are lifelong FSU football fans!\nFor their ceremony which is being led by Officiant Amanda Reeves from A Beautiful Wedding in Florida, they are doing a unity sand ceremony with the sands coloured in the FSU garnet and gold. The \u201csand\u201d is actually special glass that after the ceremony they will ship to an artist who will be blowing it into an art piece for them to keep displayed in their home. Wow, oh wow!\nAnd like many other couples who chose their date a long time ago, way before it was even a thought in Meghan and Harry\u2019s minds, they think it\u2019s kind of magical to be sharing the date with the Royals.\nSam and Andy met six years ago on a blind date in a pub. They\u2019re very excited to be having their ceremony in the grounds of Sherwood Forest and it\u2019s now even more special to them since finding out that weddings will no longer take place there and theirs will be one of the last.\nAlong with their Celebrant Gaynor Stickels, they\u2019re going to have an outdoor hand-fasting ceremony.\nDee and Ian met five years ago on the internet and are having their wedding ceremony in a little chapel on the Derbyshire Dales. As planned and created with their wedding Celebrant Ruby Beech, they\u2019re going to have readings by a family member and friend and the groom. Family members are going to sign their wedding certificate, two little family members are going to be ring bearers and they\u2019ll have a Hand-fasting, which will be led by Ruby too. Smashing!!\nAnd last, but not least, is my very own gorgeous couple, Harriet and Alex, who met on a film set in Morocco, where they both work in film and tv. They\u2019re getting married in Cortijo Rosa Blanca \u2013 a stunning Andalusian hideaway.\nFor their ceremony, Harriet\u2019s sister is going to do a reading and this fun-loving couple will get their guests singing along to not one, but two group songs! Tiny Dancer by Elton John and Can\u2019t buy me love by the Beatles! Cannot wait!\nHarriet and Alex share their thoughts on the Royal wedding.\nThank you so much to all of these awesome couples who have shared their ceremony stories with us and given us a little insight into how they\u2019re going to be spending their special day. I\u2019m sending out all the love and jubilant vibes to these wonderful couples, and ALL other couples who\u2019ll be having their wedding celebrations on May 19th. Have a good one!", "version": "v0"}

Two snags, actually: both related to the switching between the trackpad and an external trackball.\nFirst, the trackpad gets in the way when she's typing. \"Disable touchpad while typing\" was already set, but it doesn't actually work -- the mouse was always moving when her palm brushed against it.\nOn her desktop computer, she's always used a Logitech trackball -- never really got the hang of mice, but that trackball always worked well for her. And fortunately, unlike a mouse, a trackball works just fine from bed.\nOnce the trackball is working, there's really no need to have the trackpad enabled. So why not just turn it off when the external trackball is there? I thought I'd once seen a preference like that ... but it was nowhere to be found in the Gnome 2 desktop.\nUsing 0 instead of 1 turns it back on. So we gave her shell aliases for both these commands. A web search will show various approaches to writing udev rules to run something like that automatically, but she felt it was easy enough to type a command when she switches modes, so we're going with that for now.\nWe thought we were done -- until we tried to paste that alias into her shell and discovered that 2-button paste doesn't work for external mice in Squeeze.\nUsually, when you have a mouse-like device that has only two buttons, you can click the left and right buttons together to emulate a middle click. She'd been using that on her old Ubuntu Lucid install, and it works on pretty much every trackpad I've used. But it didn't work with the USB trackball on Squeeze.\nGnome used to have a preference for middle button emulation, but it's gone now. There's a program you can install called gpointing-device-settings that offers a 2-button emulation setting ... but it doesn't save the settings anywhere. And since it's a GUI program you can't make it part of your login or boot process -- you'd have to go through and click to set it every time. Not happening.\n2-buttom emulation is an X setting -- one of the settings that used to be specified in Xorg.conf, and now wanders around to different places on every distro. A little web searching didn't turn up a likely candidate for Squeeze, but it did turn up a way that's probably more distro independent: the xinput command.\nClick both buttons together, and sure enough -- a middle button paste! I added that to the alias that turns the trackpad off -- though of course, it could also be added to a udev rule that fires automatically when the mouse is plugged in.", "version": "v0"}

Yet on the C64 (Brown `Un) it sounded loud and clear?\nWell, many years ago I thought I`d take the sid chip out of my old C64 and put it in my newer C64C only to find the voice synthesis came out loud as hell but the music was almost inaudible . Hmmmm, so I piggy backed one chip on top of the other, and guess what? No more sound problems!\nAlthough this worked fine with my 64c (and a friends 64c), I cant guarantee your machine will do the same. Try It At Your Own Risk.\nRippin' off my nifty avatar?\nThe whole c64 full of little baby Sid's!\nThat's because Novaload, the SID chips in the old and newer C64 are not the same. Commodore fixed a number of \"bugs\" in the older SID chip, one of which allowed musicians to get samples running loudly. You can solder a diode onto a newer SID to get round this. You shouldn't swop SIDs between C64 and C64C because they run on different internal voltages.\nOh. Nice to know. I realised they were differnt chips by the chip id and the obvious affect it had on the system. I didnt realise the chip voltages were any different.

Thanks to my genetics, there\u2019s not an inch of me that isn\u2019t covered. From my upper lip all the way down to my toes, thick, black hair grows way too fast for my liking. I\u2019ve tried just about everything to get rid of this unwanted body air, from waxing to shaving and even laser hair removal abroad (it\u2019s much cheaper in Asia). But nothing has offered an effective, permanent solution. That\u2019s why I was intrigued when Silk\u2019n offered me the chance to try their at-home permanent hair removal device, the Silk\u2019n Infinity.\nSilk\u2019n has long been known in the skin care industry for bringing its HPL (Home Pulsed Light) technology to at-home devices. This technique uses light to permanently remove undesired hair without causing irritation, redness or ingrown hairs.\nWith the Silk\u2019n Infinity, the company moves one step further by pairing HPL with galvanic energy to create eHPL (Enhanced Home Pulsed Light). The addition of galvanic energy allows for the opening up of pores to target even the most stubborn hair follicles. Together optical and galvanic energy promise smooth, hair-free skin without any pain and irritation.\nIn addition to galvanic energy, the Infinity eHPL hair removal device offers some additional upgrades on previous models. For example, the device features five power settings for customizable treatments based on your skin type and tone. Plus, the new and improved quartz bulb allows for faster pulses and therefore faster treatment sessions. A full-body treatment can be completed in about half an hour (in my personal experience). And, while not a new development, the Infinity boasts a free companion app and a lifetime of treatments backed up by a one-year manufacturer\u2019s warranty.\nI was actually really nervous to use the Infinity for the first time. I didn\u2019t have a great experience with laser hair removal in the past. It was painful and I broke out in welts after every treatment. However, the Infinity\u2019s treatments were quick and thankfully painless.\nTo prep for treatment, I shaved, cleaned and dried my skin. Then, I powered up the device by plugging it in and pressing the control button. As a side note, the device came with a number of international adapters, so I was able to use it both at my home in the USA and while I was traveling through Europe.\nAround the control button, there are a number of lights that show the energy level. I started my first treatment with energy level 1 as suggested. During my second and third treatments, I was able to increase that to energy level 2 after completing the all-important spot test.\nThe other light on the back of the device is the ready or skin tone indicator light. For me, this was the most confusing part of using the Silk\u2019n Infinity. The light stays on if the device is powered up. Placing the device on your skin will trigger a skin tone test to ensure your skin will absorb enough light for hair removal. If the light blinks rapidly, your skin tone is too dark. However, a slow blink seems to indicate the Silk\u2019n is ready to fire.\nOnce I had the Silk\u2019n Infinity ready to go, treating my skin was super easy. All I had to do was make contact with the base electrode on the back of the device and press the pulse button. This created a flash of light that is essentially the optical and galvanic energy making its way into my skin. Holding down the pulse button creates a steady stream of flashes that allowed me to continuously treat large areas, such as my legs, in what I would call a shaving motion. For smaller areas, I simply used the single pulse option, moving the device after each pulse.\nI\u2019m happy to report that I am beginning to see results after the first three treatments. Following the first treatment, my hair grew back as usual, but now I am definitely seeing a decrease in hair growth and a few bald spots showing up. The results are certainly promising.\nOverall, I would have been nervous to spend such a large amount of money on a device that seems rather, well, gimmicky. But I\u2019m happy that I was able to try the Silk\u2019n Infinity. It\u2019s easy to use, doesn\u2019t hurt at all and has provided me with less hair growth in just a few weeks. If it continues to work as well as it has until now, I will never need to pay for laser hair removal, go for a wax or buy razors again. And that\u2019s a huge win in my book!", "version": "v0"}

This name, which might feel a bit old-fashioned, refers to both the building at Mita Campus as well as the administrative offices that support the university and can be roughly translated as the \u201cKeio Corporate Administration.\u201d The building, now 90 years old, has grown together with Keio University over the years.\nWhile unfamiliar to many Keio students today\u2014as most rarely have occasion to visit the building\u2014the Jukukan-kyoku is built of brick in the Gothic tradition and located near the East Gate of Mita Campus, between the Old University Library and the Mita Media Center. Over 90 years have now passed since its completion in 1926 by Tatsuzo Sone and Seiichiro Chujo, who also designed the Old University Library, which was completed in 1912.\nThe word Jukukan-kyoku, again, is not only the name of a building. It also refers to the administrative offices that are responsible for the general affairs of Keio University. The rare name is thought to have derived from the jukukan administrative offices of Tekijuku, Ogata Koan\u2019s school where Keio founder Yukichi Fukuzawa studied as a young man and which would later become Osaka University.\n\u201cArticle 5: To gain admission to the school, you must provide proof of identity to a professor and receive permission from the Jukukan-kyoku.\"\nFrom this, we know that even at that time the Jukukan-kyoku helped handle admissions. After the school\u2019s move to Mita, the Jukukan-kyoku\u2019s role grew from admissions to managing dormitories and attendance as well as book lending and other educational affairs, effectively functioning as the administrative arm of the school.\nAnd with the evolution of Keio, the role of the Jukukan-kyoku continued to gradually expand. According to regulations regarding the division of work duties from around the turn of the 20th century, all Keio matters were to be handled through one of three positions: the vice principal, the jukukan (head administrator), or the head of accounting. The position of jukukan was created primarily to oversee administrative affairs and management of the Kishukusha\u2014Keio\u2019s first dormitory. The position came to possess as much authority as the vice principal of education. Eventually, the position of jukukan was eliminated, and in the early 20th century the phrase Jukukan-kyoku came to mean the headquarters of Keio\u2019s administrative offices.\nIts halls housed Keio\u2019s first undergraduate faculties, established in 1890, and were later used for classrooms and Jukukan-kyoku offices. While the building was damaged during the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, it was the aftershocks that rendered it unusable, and the building was demolished the following year. The building you see today was built on the same site in 1926.\nThe organization of the Jukukan-kyoku underwent several administrative reforms both before and after the Second World War to adapt to the mounting administrative responsibilities of the times.\nThe current organizational chart of Keio shows the large branches of the educational structures that comprise the university and its extensive network of integrated schools. The Jukukan-kyoku, the core of Keio\u2019s administrative offices, makes up another large branch, the heart of of Keio\u2019s corporate arm.\nInside the physical Jukukan-kyoku building itself are the Administrative Affairs Office, Office of Human Resources Management, Accounting and Finance Office, Facility Management Office, and Office of Communications and Public Relations.\nWhile the austere simplicity of the Jukukan-kyoku has never become as symbolic as the Old University Library, it has kept a watchful eye over Keio as a quiet pillar of support throughout its history.", "version": "v0"}

But, did you know that the state also has tons of awesome craft breweries? Today, I\u2019m giving y\u2019all an inside look at one of my favorite breweries here in the Bluegrass: Dry Ground.\nI\u2019m absolutely obsessed with Dry Ground because everything they do is rooted in history! They\u2019re super committed to supporting the Paducah community, especially local artists. Oh, and they make pretty delicious beer.\nSpecial thanks to Cameron of Cameron Hesson Photography for the images in this post and Cory of Dry Ground Brewing Co. for showing us around!\nDry Ground is situated inside the Old Coke Plant in Paducah, KY. While the space is currently home to several local businesses, Dry Ground has an extra special connection to the building: the building gave the brewery its name.\nThe Coke Plant originally stood on South 6th Street. The Ohio River flooded in 1937 and flooded the site to the dismay of the owner, Mr. Luther Carson. He lamented that if he could ever find \u201cdry ground\u201d, he\u2019d build a new Coca Cola plant in that spot. He ended up at the Red Cross evacuation space 31 blocks from the river and decided to build his new plant right across the street. Construction began immediately and his new, state of the art Coca Cola bottling plant opened in June of 1939. Exciting times!\nThe Coke Plant thrived and had become famous in western Kentucky by Carson\u2019s death in 1962. Coca Cola bought the rights to the plant back around 1986. They changed the plants function from bottling to serving as a distribution center. The Coke Plant closed in 2005 and sat empty until the Musselman\u2019s stepped up to buy it. They restored the Coke Plant to its 1930s art deco glory and began filling the space with local businesses in 2017!\nDry Ground moved in and became Paducah\u2019s first craft brewery. Mellow Mushroom became the building\u2019s anchor tenant, decorating their walls with art from local artists. Piper\u2019s Tea and Coffee settled and has become a go-to for Paducah\u2019s caffeine lovers. There\u2019s even a yoga studio, recording studio, ice cream shop, music lesson space, and a digital marketing company. All of these spaces required tons of work to move in to, and that work has paid off. The Coke Plant is a truly special place in the heart of Paducah.\nOn top of being in a super cool building, Dry Ground itself has a really cool vibe! All of their beers are fermented in the tap-room, which means that there are big, shining fermenting tanks lining the walls! All of their beers have a super cool logo and that art decorates the walls above the taps.\nYou\u2019ll pass a super cool sticker wall and Kentucky mural on the way toward the back of the space, which is a special events and music venue. Growlers from a variety of Kentucky breweries line the windows, picnic tables are scattered around, and string lights spot the space. You\u2019ll really feel right at home in the space. I haven\u2019t seen any live music at Dry Ground (yet), but I\u2019m confident that it\u2019s an unforgettable experience.\nShortly after my visit to Dry Ground with Cameron and Cory, I returned to grab a beer with my uncle (who lives in Paducah). I quickly found out that we have a bit of a funny family tie to the brewery! There\u2019s a small velvet Elvis painting decorating a wall near one of the exits. Turns out, it\u2019s the same velvet Elvis painting that my mother gave my uncle years ago \u2013 and he gave it to the brewery! Such a small world.\nLike the name, Paducah history is interwoven with the beers Dry Ground brews. Naturally, Dry Ground has a beer named after the event that caused the Coke Plant to move: the \u201937 Flood (an American IPA). Paducah locals are often also the inspiration behind the brews.\nDella Barnes (a hazy IPA) is named after a local woman with the same name. One man proposed to Della, but she turned him down and married someone else. Legend says that the heartbroken man went into a fit of rage and cut Della\u2019s finger off, causing her to bleed to death*. She was buried in the Oak Grove cemetery with a statue in her likeness marking the grave. The ring finger broke off over time and visitors said that they\u2019d see the statue bleeding or crying. The statue is long gone but the legend of Miss Della Barnes lives on.\n*Her obituary says that Della actually died by an accidental poisoning.\nTheir Speedy Adkins (a hazy IPA) is also named after a local with a weirder (and much more depressing) background. Speedy Adkins was an African-American Paducah tobacco worker who didn\u2019t become well-known until after he drowned in the Ohio River in 1928. Speedy\u2019s remains went to A.Z. Hamcock, his friend and a local funeral home owner. Hamcock decided to test a powerful new preservative out on his buddy Speedy. Essentially, the preservative mummified Speedy Adkins and Hamcock would often display him in the funeral home. The remains became a bit of a road side attraction. Speedy finally got his funeral in 1994.\nWhen they aren\u2019t brewing beers based on local lore, they\u2019re partnering with other local businesses to make one heck of a fantastic product. A partnership between Dry Ground, Pipers, and Flower and Furbish created Cross Pollination (a saison with rose and lavender). I tried quite a few beers during my visit (gotta love flights!) and Cross Pollination was easily my favorite. Dry Ground also frequently partners with Paducah artists to create the graphics for their beers, which are all beautifully done!\nSpecial thanks to Cory for showing Cameron and I around Dry Ground and The Coke Plant!\nI really, really love all the things Dry Ground is dong, both with their beer and within the local community. If you find yourself in western Kentucky, definitely make visiting Dry Ground a priority.\nDoes your town have a brewery worth checking out? Let me know in the comments below!\nPS.

This leads you to being constantly hungry and eating more food. Result: your weight increases.\nOf course, the key to weight loss is exercising but not exercising like a fiend. The human body needs at least 2,000 to 2,500 calories and people on a diet can sometimes ingest less than 1,200 calories. Due to your low calorie diet, less energy is stored in the body.\nAll these factors contribute to a slow metabolism rate, so when you finally eat a normal amount of food again, it increases your weight.\nWhile trying to lose weight, it is recommended that you lower your sugar intake but this does not mean that you cut out natural sources of sugar completely from your diet.

I'm just ready for the warmer months and the warmer clothing styles that come with that. That's why I have these lace-up ballet flats on my mind. It's like a dainty edge that I can't live without. The Miu Miu flats are obviously on the pricier side, but these are some awesome ones under $40 from Nastygal that you'll love, too.\nWhen it comes to fashion mags, I usually stick to InStyle, but when it comes to anything else, I'm all about my Entertainment Weekly. One of my friends recently got me a subscription to it, and it's honestly the best gift ever for me. I don't necessarily care about celebrity news, but I love learning about movies, music, books and TV shows. EW is seriously like my bible. Why else do you think I have an entire category on the Muse all about entertainment and reviews.\nFor this month, I couldn't just do one type of shoe. Not when these pom pom flats caught my eye as well! I mean, how adorable, especially right now when putting pom poms on anything and everything just works. In December I actually donated about 6-10 pairs of shoes, and I was really excited to clear out my closet. But now I feel like I donated the old shoes just to make room for new ones, like these from Forever 21!\nI was also featured in Independent Fashion Bloggers' Links a la Mode this week for my Beauty and Tech post from the other day. See all the featured posts below.\nStyle Mouse: Would You Wear Glitter Shoes?\nThe lace up ballet flats are truly doable !\nand yes I did have a BD on the 21st ;) Thks.\nI'm not sure I could pull off the lac up ballet flats, but they are super cute!

I want a pair of pom pom flats now!\nI love the lace-up ballet flats that look like real ballerinas. Did you see the amazing pink ones with black and white gingham ribbon laces by Miu Miu??? SWOON!!!\nThose lace up ballet flats so so darling! I would so wear them if I wasn't so short! I have to get as much height out of my shoes as I can!

Maybe you have put off installing one because you don\u2019t have much space to work with, or perhaps you were concerned about the quality of the results? Well you can put all those fears to rest. We can get you the luxurious backyard pool you have always dreamed of, no matter how much space you have to work with. Sound too good to be true? It\u2019s not. Our experienced professionals can handle any small-scale pool construction project to get you the backyard oasis you have always wanted.\nThe size and shape of your backyard will be the key factors in determining the design of your pool. Depending on how much space you are working with, you can choose any shape you like. We suggest you choose a design that is both elegant and yet practical for scaling to your property space.\nMost visitors tend to notice the shape of your pool before they pay any attention to its actual size. Therefore you should try to select an aesthetically pleasing shape that both looks great, and saves on space. Free-form designs, such as curved, kidney-shaped pools, and those with smooth curves and edges, tend to save the most space in your yard. This leaves you room for additional features like a dining area, or patio furniture.\nAlthough smaller pools naturally require less direct, hands-on maintenance work because of their reduced surface area and use of less water, you should still select a design that requires as little maintenance as possible, or at least one that is simple to maintain. Concrete pools and decks, for example, require daily cleaning in order to maintain a quality appearance. Vinyl liners, on the other hand, are much easier to clean, but unlike concrete, are more susceptible to damage. Pools made with fiberglass are the most cost-effective pools because they require the least amount of care, but they are also very expensive, so consider your options carefully.\nJust because you have small backyard does not mean you that should give up on your dream of a fancy, aesthetically pleasing backyard oasis. Even pools that are smaller in size but artistically designed have the ability to turn a few heads and stir up some envious looks. And there is no need to worry about construction or installation. Our certified experts will walk you through the whole process and work to ensure your satisfaction is met and you are left with the beautiful backyard pool you have always dreamed of.\nHome Blog Can Your Small Backyard Accommodate an Inground Swimming Pool?", "version": "v0"}

This will lead, in the end, to a discussion of the practice of Odinism.\nAs Aristotle saw (and later Hegel, following Aristotle) man recapitulates within himself the rest of nature, in possessing the appetitive and nutritive functions (plant nature), and the sensory and locomotive (animal nature). Biologically, we comprise the whole \u2013 in a sense we combine all creatures within ourselves; we are all things. We are the microcosm that reflects the macrocosm. But we step beyond all other creatures at the same time, in being capable of achieving self-knowledge. Thus, in striving to know ourselves \u2013 which always necessarily involves, as Hegel makes clear, finding ourselves in the world around us, taking an interest in all \u2013 we are the whole knowing itself. Man occupies a privileged position in nature, reigning over all as the highest terrestrial being \u2013 in virtue both of his knowledge, and his power. Man is part beast, part god (as Aristotle recognized).\nThe above only puts the argument of Section Two in a slightly different way. The next step is to recognize that man\u2019s knowledge or consciousness of the whole (which is simultaneously his self-consciousness, in the most profound sense) is purely impersonal. Each man is, to one degree or another, the \u201ccarrier\u201d of this consciousness, but it is something radically distinct from my consciousness of myself as an individual. To achieve knowledge of the whole, I must go beyond the personal ego and its attachments, and identify myself with a \u201chigher self\u201d that strives to embrace all. In other words, I must sacrifice myself to myself.\nThe \u2018birth\u2019 of \u00d3dhinn and the World-Tree sacrifice are essentially simultaneous \u2013 without it \u00d3dhinn is not \u00d3dhinn. In this process \u00d3dhinn gives his self to him-Self while hanging on Yggdrasill (the steed of Yggr [ = Odin], or the yew column). The subject has turned upon itself and has successfully made itself the object of its own work.\nThe key to this question is to be found in the story of Odin\u2019s self-sacrifice on Yggdrasill. I have dealt with this matter in another essay. Here I will approach the same material in a different and much simpler way.\nI cannot deny that I was awed by my first glimpse of this short, stocky man with a sharp, commanding tongue. Even his manner of speaking was sharp and cutting. Well aware of his listeners\u2019 weaknesses, he tried in every way to make himself understood by them. He made every effort to provide proofs for everything he said; but his speech still seemed commanding, as if he wanted to dispel any possible doubts by means of an unconditional order. \u201cGentlemen,\u201d he would say, \u201ccollect your thoughts and enter into yourselves. We are not at all concerned now with anything external, but only with ourselves.\u201d And, just as he requested, his listeners really seemed to be concentrating upon themselves. Some of them shifted their position and sat up straight, while others slumped with downcast eyes. But it was obvious that they were all waiting with great suspense for what was supposed to come next. Then Fichte would continue: \u201cGentlemen, think the wall!\u201d And as I saw, they really did think about the wall, and everyone seemed able to do so with success. \u201cHave you thought about the wall?\u201d Fichte would ask. \u201cNow, gentlemen, think him who thinks the wall.\u201d The obvious confusion and embarrassment provoked by this request was extraordinary. In fact, many of the listeners seemed quite unable to discover anywhere whoever it was that had thought about the wall. I now understood how young men who had stumbled in such a memorable manner over their first attempt at speculation might have fallen into a very dangerous frame of mind as a result of their further efforts in this direction.\nIn the magical, dry, or solar way, you will create a duality in your being not in an unconscious and passive manner (as the mystic does), but consciously and willingly; you will shift directly on the higher part and identify yourself with that superior and subsistent principle . . . Slowly but gradually, you will strengthen this \u2018other\u2019 (which is yourself [i.e., your Self]) and create for it a supremacy, until it knows how to dominate all the powers of the [lower] natural part and master them totally. What is required of you is a discipline of firmness and sobriety until an equilibrium is created, namely the quality of a life that owns itself and is free with regard to itself, cleansed from instinct and from the obscure appetite of the natural being, in both flesh and mind.\nAs I have noted, remaining identified with the Self is extraordinarily difficult. There are a number of different sources which contain hints about how to go about achieving this. These include the works of Edred Thorsson and Julius Evola (though they offer only hints; both writers know more than they are willing to say openly). There is, in addition, a great deal of practical information to be found in works dealing with the so-called \u201cFourth Way\u201d teaching of the Greek-Armenian mystic G. I. Gurdjieff (1866-1949), a decidedly Odinic figure. For all intents and purposes, Gurdjieff\u2019s \u201cself-remembering\u201d is identical to the practice I have described here.\nThe Fourth Way is practiced in the world, not in separation from it. Gurdjieff contrasts it to three other paths: the way of the fakir (who works to master the body), the way of the monk (who masters the emotions), and the way of the yogi (who masters the mind or intellect). These paths not only tend to involve the isolation of the practitioner from the world, they lead, so Gurdjieff believed, to one-sided development. The Fourth Way works on mastering all aspects of the self and, again, it requires that this self-mastery be sought while the practitioner is fully engaged with life. And we must take special note of the fact that Gurdjieff offered his teaching as a mystical path for the West. It is also easy to see that the Fourth Way belongs to the left-hand path. It uses the distractions and pressures of modern life as a means to mastering the self. For just this reason, it is obvious that this path is well-suited to the present time: the Wolf Age, Iron Age, or Kali Yuga. Finally, it is a tough way: there is nothing \u201ctouchy-feely\u201d about it (which is why many New Age types tend to be put off by Gurdjieff).\nNevertheless, the Fourth Way has much to teach us about the practice of Odinism; i.e., the technique of identification with the Self. But Gurdjieff\u2019s followers are also notoriously guarded about the actual methods of what they call \u201cthe Work,\u201d insisting that it can only be imparted through \u201cgroup.\u201d To an Odinist, this is nothing more than a gauntlet thrown down, for we are not \u201cjoiners.\u201d One must therefore \u201cread around\u201d quite a bit in Fourth Way literature and connect many dots in order to uncover what the actual practice consists in.\nWhat is required, first of all, is the simple act of \u201cself-observation.\u201d In this act, the self \u2013 as described above \u2013 bifurcates into an active, watching self, and a self that is watched. (This watching self and the Self, I have argued, are metaphysically identical.) Just what do we observe? Begin with the practice of grounding yourself in the present moment. Focus on bodily sensations: on the experience of touch, sight, sound, smell. Thoughts will come to you about what you are touching, seeing, etc. Observe this, and then gently draw yourself back to the experience of the sensations themselves. Properly practiced, this will give rise to a very special sort of realization which, if put into words, would simply say \u201cI am.\u201d It should be obvious that what is involved in self-observation is a very special form of attention or awareness in which you become intensely present to Being. This almost inevitably leads to the experience I have described elsewhere as Ekstasis \u2013 wonder in the face of Being, in the sheer fact that things are \u2013 which I have argued is equivalent to \u00f3\u00f0r of which Odin is the personification.\nIt should be obvious by now that this practice requires extraordinary patience. It is a constant struggle between finite and infinite attention; between attachment and detachment; between the ordinary, mundane self or I and the World I or Self. But, with practice, it gets easier.\nIf you want to approach our Art, be aware that this is a painful struggle and somewhat like walking on a razor\u2019s edge. You may win or lose, and two things lead to certain disaster: to be afraid and to interrupt the operation. Once you have begun, you must go all the way, since an interruption leads to a dreadful reaction, with the opposite result. You can easily understand why: at every step you take, an increasingly higher quantity of swirling energy is arrested and pushed upstream; having been excited and provoked, it is filled with tension. As soon as you give up, it will come crashing down upon you and sweep you away. . . . One does not have to embark [on this path], but once you have done so, there are only two alternatives: succeed or perish.\nPublished: August 2, 2017 | This entry was posted in North American New Right, philosophy, self-help and tagged Abraxis, Collin Cleary, Edred Thorsson, G.

Both comments and trackbacks are currently closed.\nIt seems like you have already thought this thing through. The next step now is to convey your ideas through audiovisual media, podcasts, videos. Popular names among the right today wouldn\u2019t have reached an infinitesimal amount of the public they have if they only wrote articles. Even if one were to focus solely on the special point of view of the Christianity versus paganism debate, Christian pastors, apologists record all their sermons and talks and upload them to internet, whereas content creators from the pagan side are scarce. What to say of the larger cultural and political issues? In the contemporary struggle for hegemony, you simply can\u2019t do without audio and video.\nThat\u2019s a good point, but writing and theory will always be important because it influences the people who then influence average people with popular, and emotive, methods like video, music, all the different forms of art.\nYour suggestion here, Van der Er, points us to a true predicament.\nMr. Cleary\u2019s extremely interesting article culminates on a note of esotericism. Esotericism cannot be publicized; publicized esotericism is even a contradiction in terms. If Mr. Cleary seeks wider audience for his ideas, he will certainly have to leave the soul of them aside. One is permitted to wonder how much the remainder will be worth.\nSuch is the nub of this \u201ccontemporary struggle for hegemony.\u201d How are we as lovers of excellence to popularize? If we don\u2019t popularize, then how are we going to get anywhere at all\u2014and if we do popularize, how can we ever do so without compromising what is best in us, which, being best, is perforce unpopular?", "version": "v0"}

By comparison, 2,404 people were killed at Pearl Harbor in the Dec. 7, 1941 attack.\nOne can compare something else. On the days following both attacks, you could not look in any direction in any American city or town and not see a flag waving.\n\u201cThe American Muslim Political Action Committee has scheduled a rally to draw attention to what they call unfair fear of Muslims after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks,\u201d the newspaper said.\nAnother story in the same newspaper said the bikers far outnumbered those at the Muslim event.\nEvents of the past 24 hours have provided a reminder that if you tell Americans they cannot do something, there will be payback and it could be massive. Tell them they cannot hold a rally in the nation\u2019s capital and they will be there by the thousands, flags flying and motorcycle engines roaring.\nTell them they cannot own the firearm of their choice and, at least in Colorado, they will throw you out of office. Tell them it is a waste of public money and they will counter that it is never a waste of public money to kick a politician out of office, then talk about it on-line.\nTwelve years is a long time in American politics. It provides much opportunity for opinions to shift, but when the chips are down people tend to gravitate toward what they know, and in this country, people know freedom and independence best of all. That\u2019s what drives firemen to run into burning buildings, even ones hit by airplanes. It\u2019s what drives policemen to run toward trouble, even inside flaming skyscrapers.\nEvery day in some way, big or small, some American does his or her little bit for freedom and liberty. We wave flags. We remember those with unfinished lives. We finish political careers, often with gusto.\nAmericans have learned over the past dozen years that we do things today because each tomorrow holds an uncertain future. The events of 12 years ago, much like the events of 24 hours ago in Colorado, prove that.\nUPDATE: Public Policy Polling is acknowledging today that it conducted a poll last weekend which showed Colorado Sen. Angela Giron losing by 12 points, but that it did not release the results of that poll prior to yesterday\u2019s election. Legal Insurrection talks about it here.\nFor Jensen to claim that the new Colorado gun laws are \u201cpretty unobtrusive\u201d and that the NRA turned the election into something \u201cbigger than it was\u201d could get quite an argument from Colorado gun owners who voted her out of office.", "version": "v0"}

Contact Alain at astephens@kut.org, or (512) 232-6173.\nSince his inauguration, President Donald Trump has kept his campaign promises of tougher immigration policies, leading to a constant flow of policy changes \u2014 from scaling back on programs like Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to his \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy along the border that\u2019s led to separation of parents and children attempting to cross into the U.S.\nAll of these individual actions amount to a broader strategy that is now becoming clear.\nCan A 'Red Flag' Gun Law Fly In A Red State?\nState representatives on Monday will begin discussing whether a \"red flag\" law giving courts the ability to remove guns from a person considered dangerous would work in Texas.\nWhy Don't We Regulate Semiautomatic Guns The Same Way We Regulate Automatic Ones?\nAs Texas debates what, if any, steps should be taken to prevent mass shootings in the state, we asked our audience what questions they had about guns in schools.\nThe Austin City Council passed a resolution today preventing the police department from selling used guns to the public.\nOver the weekend, an estimated 80,000 people descended on the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center in Dallas for the National Rifle Association\u2019s annual meeting \u2013 over 900 firearms and gun-related vendors, along with politicians from President Trump to Governor Greg Abbott. The event was a window into an organization that, in the wake of shootings such as Parkland and Sutherland Springs, has been under increased scrutiny.\nDefining violent crime can be trickier than it sounds. Mugging someone on a sidewalk or robbing a store with a firearm are obviously violent acts. But, what about stealing something from an unoccupied and unlocked home? Even the Supreme Court has difficulty making the call.\nRemington Arms \u2013 a gun company that has been in business for over 200 years \u2013 has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and they\u2019re not the only gun company that has seen shrinking profits lately. Sturm Ruger, as well as American Outdoors Brand, formerly known as Smith and Wesson, have been taking hits, too. Is Remington a victim of shifting public sentiment surrounding guns \u2013 or is something else going on?\nIn February, a video was released on the website Voice of Jihad \u2013 a piece of propaganda created by the Taliban that displays an overnight raid against Afghan security forces in Kandahar.\nMuch of the discussion surrounding firearms is about gun control measures and violence. But the gun industry, just like any other industry, has been going through it own ups and downs. All of that came to a head just last week when firearms giant Remington said it would file for bankruptcy. And they aren\u2019t the only company facing increasingly difficult challenges as market demands shift.\nMichael Cargill owns and operates Central Texas Gun Works, a gun store in Austin.\nPentagon officials have undertaken a new policy that seeks to get rid of non-deployable military members. Is it a move to maintain a leaner, meaner fighting force? Or is the military simply not accounting for thousands of support personnel?\nWe\u2019re three days into 2018 \u2013 how are your New Year\u2019s resolutions going? If you stumble along the way, you\u2019re not alone; some research shows that up to 80 percent of people who make a resolution will have given up on it by February.\nWhen it comes to combating Mexican drug cartels, law enforcement agencies have aimed at the head, aiming to weakening them by eliminate the groups\u2019 leadership. According to the Congressional Research Service, Capitol Hill\u2019s nonpartisan think tank, 107 of Mexico\u2019s 122 most violent criminals have been removed from cartels. The results? Violence has surged, with media outlets reporting that death tolls have hit 20 year highs. So how did this explosion of violence happen and what\u2019s coming next?\nEconomists and Democrats have leveled a lot of criticism at the GOP tax plan that just passed in Congress. But for many of the 200,000 AT&T workers who have been told they will receive a $1,000 bonus, thanks to the plan, things probably seem pretty good. And that may be the big idea.\nWhy Didn't Shooter's Military Charges Stop Him From Buying A Gun?\nSeveral news outlets have reported that Devin Patrick Kelley, the suspect in a deadly mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, bought the weapon used in the attack from an Academy Sports and Outdoors store in San Antonio. Given Kelley\u2019s history of domestic violence, some are saying he shouldn\u2019t have been allowed to buy a firearm in the first place.\nWhy Is The FBI Worried About 'Black Identity Extremists'?\nFederal law enforcement officials are concerned about what they believe is a new threat within the United States. It's not white supremacists or neo-Nazis, but another politically motivated group.\nThe agency says \"black identity extremists\" could be the next domestic terror threat.\nBut some say the FBI's move is less about law enforcement and more about Trump administration rhetoric and a history of tamping down minority political activism.\nThe Texas Legislature has discussed the idea of raising the age of criminal responsibility during the two most recent sessions. It\u2019s a topic that will be debated this weekend at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin. Several proposals would consider treating 17-year-olds as juveniles, rather than adults, for purposes of criminal prosecution and sentencing. That change would align Texas with the majority of the country. Many proponents of such a change cite new research regarding cognitive development and lowered recidivism rates for offenders in the juvenile justice system. And there may be another reason making such a change could benefit the state.\nIrma and Harvey delivered a one-two punch to two major airline hubs: Houston and Miami. We've heard a lot about the electrical grid, the impact on roads and infrastructure, but what effect did the hurricanes have on airline businesses?\nThe North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect January 1, 1994 The pact was created to bolster trading of commodities between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, by eliminating trade tariffs. But some argue that making it cheaper to trade also made it easier for companies to move American jobs elsewhere.\nThe saying, you\u2019re only as good as your equipment, has serious implications for first responders. A faulty service weapon can mean the difference between life and death for police officers and those they protect, which makes what's happening in Houston all the more frightening.\nA new study has opened fire against the commonly held belief \u2013 particularly in Texas \u2013 that carrying guns can reduce violent crime.\nCould A Private Air Force Replace U.S. Troops In Afghanistan?\nA controversial proposal to bring American troops home from Afghanistan, replacing them with contractors, wouldn\u2019t involve private citizens manning tanks or Humvees. Instead, they would fly military-style planes above the battlefield \u2013 amounting to a private air force. The proposal comes from Erik Prince, whose contacting firm Blackwater made headlines during the Iraq War.\nA type of synthetic marijuana that is undetectable on standard drug tests is quickly becoming the most popular form of contraband in Texas prisons.\nThere are a lot of labels in the world of politics. There are Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives and even libertarians. But socialists is another thing altogether. Socialists are pretty close to communists, as some see it.\nFor years, the socialist label has been something of a taboo, not just in Texas but in many parts of the country. Today though, many younger voters are leaning hard left, and they\u2019re looking to old-school socialists for leadership and inspiration.\nOn Monday, Russia threatened to shoot down any coalition jets flying west of the Euphrates river, after the U.S. shot down a Syrian warplane over the weekend. Russia is also suspending its use of the hotline between the U.S. and Russia that was set up to prevent accidents in the Syrian combat zone. The U.S. has also suspended talks with Russia over resolution of the Syrian conflict.\nEver sat at the gas pump, and just wondered when enough is enough? Constantly fluctuating gas prices, the wasted time spent sitting at the pump \u2013 not to mention fumes, smog and other environmental factors \u2013 all lead to the search for a better alternative.\nIs There A Legal Justification For Regulating Social Media?\nIn the wake of last weekend\u2019s terrorist attack in London that left seven people dead, Prime Minister Theresa May has gone beyond asking social media companies to vet content posted on their sites more fully. She\u2019s raised the specter of holding social media platforms legally accountable for facilitating the spread of terrorist ideology.", "version": "v0"}

Eighty percent of Americans now live in metropolitan areas, and the advantages and challenges of living in these developed areas\u2014convenience, congestion, employment, pollution\u2014are part of the day-to-day realities of most Americans.\nEvery stream is connected downstream to larger water bodies, including rivers, reservoirs, and ultimately coastal waters. Inputs of chemical contaminants or sediments at any point along the stream can cause degradation downstream with adverse effects on biological communities and on economically valuable resources, such as fisheries and tourism.\nIn response to general concerns about the degradation of urban streams, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) conducted a national-scale, scientific investigation of the effects of urban development on stream ecosystems. Nine metropolitan study areas of the United States were selected\u2014Portland, Oregon; Salt Lake City, Utah; Birmingham, Alabama; Atlanta, Georgia; Raleigh, North Carolina; Boston, Massachusetts; Denver, Colorado; Dallas, Texas; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\nThe studies were conducted in Salt Lake City, Birmingham, and Boston in 1999\u20132000; in Atlanta, Raleigh, and Denver in 2002\u20132003; and in Portland, Dallas, and Milwaukee in 2003\u20132004.\n1.

Which urban-related stressors are most closely linked to biological community degradation, and how can multiple stressors be managed to protect stream health as a watershed becomes increasingly urbanized?\nThis report serves as a companion report associated with the NAWQA effects of urban development on stream ecosystems Circular 1373, and illustrates management strategies used in the United States to reduce the impacts of urban development on stream systems described in Coles and others, 2012 (see Effects of Urbanization on Stream Ecosystems). Chapter 2 of this report presents a brief history of urban stream management in the United States, providing a context for the management strategies presented in later chapters. Chapter 3 introduces broad management goals linked to the USGS urban study findings about the relation between urban development and the physical, chemical, and biological condition of stream systems, and illustrates how these goals have been addressed using case study examples.\nChapter 4 presents more detailed examples of management strategies that can be used to suppport the broad goals introduced in Chapter 3. The management strategies are drawn from the experiences of jurisdictions that are seeking to protect the condition of streams in urbanizing watersheds.\nThese strategies are presented not as recommended courses of action but as examples of how municipalities have responded to the challenges of managing urban streams. Chapter 5 discusses three recurring challenges faced by those managing urbanizing streams as they develop and implement management strategies to improve the health of these stream systems.", "version": "v0"}

It has now come to HOME as part of their inaugural Orbit Festival.\nMcNair\u2019s grandfather, Archie, was a lifelong lover of gambling and raconteur of colourful stories, which would become part of local folk legend - although these should be taken with large 'pinch of salt' and may be more memorable than trustful. A Gambler\u2019s Guide repeatedly returns to a revolving yarn about Archie putting a bet on England to win in the 1966 World Cup final. This subsequently invited the hatred of his fellow Scots and eventually getting him beaten up in a bar in the Gorbals.\nThe relentlessly optimist Scottish rascal educates his fascinated young grandson in the art of gambling and we see their special relationship grow and develop into a form of childhood hero worship.\nThe staging, patterned carpet and cardboard boxes, lighting and McNair\u2019s clothing all combine to create a nostalgic quality. The jazz drumming subtlety assists in propelling the story forward and even though ultimately about facing the Grim Reaper, it always manages to stay on the right-side of mawkish, delivering a warm, uplifting and life-affirming piece.\nThis is a delightfully warm and earthily comical performance and wonderfully demonstrates the act of storytelling. McNair\u2019s witty rollercoaster performance is strong, committed and engaging.", "version": "v0"}

It has signified a growth of 0.78% compared to July. 1,8 million new jobs were opened in the last eight months. The state of Sao Paulo is the one that has increased the most within about 725 thousand new roles.\nThat's true! Inside the city of Sao Paulo, it's possible to see how busy and noisy the city is right now. Everyone is working, no one has time enough to have lunch or even complain about lack in the market place. It's such an important economic change as Brazil has never seen before. Lots of investitors are coming to S\u00e3o Paulo and starting new business.\nThose numbers about new jobs are a proof of it, because they means official places in the market, paying taxes and declaring gains. It used to be hiden years ago. People didn't want to show their gains trying to avoid fees with the government. In this brand new situation it's impossible to avoid formal job. Mainly on the building sector, where big investitors are starting to play. Also on the service's sector there are lots of new roles. There are lots of money running out and lots of jobs to do.\nSince the beginning of this year, Brazil started to release easier loan for average people. It's warming up the economy and also the furniture sector, plumber's, eletrician's, eletronic device's... More than 120 thousand houses were already financed this year.\nThe Minister of Labour and Employment, Carlos Lupi, is smiling as a child inside a toy shop. He also makes optimistic predictions regarding the new situation. \"We will pass the 2 million jobs by the end of the year,\" he said. \"Brazil has become a Mecca of big business\", confirming. According to him, employment growth in Brazil is a phenomenon that grabs the attention in the world. \"These are significant numbers even in comparison with China.\"\nBrazil is still growing up even amoung this crisis around US. The government is self confident about the growth. Sao Paulo is the place where most of this changes are happening now.\nSan Gennaro's Italian Party has already started but it goes every Saturdays and Sundays till 12th October. That's the 35th edition of the festival located in Mooca (S\u00e3o Paulo's East region) and it expects to receive more than 120 thousand visitors.\nA total of 22 tents will be located in the area of free access. It's possible to find between them, traditional Italian dishes, such as: pasta, pizzas, polentas, fogazzas, sweets, among other typical foods. It's necessary buying tickets in a special area to get food. It'll be accepted, further money, Visa cards and Visa Eletron. Two public toilets are built between the streets of Mooca and Lins, and to have access, it'll be charged R$ 0,50.\nThe area where the concerts happen, has capacity for one thousand people. The individual ticket costs R$ 35 (Saturday) and R$ 20 (Sunday) and it includes an antipasto, a dish of pasta and two slices of pizza.\nThe singer Fred Rovella and the band L\u00e1 M\u00e1fia Nostra will be every single day at the festival. In their songlist are sucess such as Sapore di Sale, Se Non Avessi Pi\u00f9 Te and Io Che Non Vivo, in addition to the classics O Sole Mio, Amore Scusami, Dio Come Ti Amo and Volare.\nSaturday from 6pm till midnight and Sunday from 6pm till 11h30pm.\nIt's always the same: waiting in a queue to get in at Famiglia Mancini's. It's amazing how famous is this traditional Italian restaurant in Sao Paulo. Located at the first renewed street in the center of Sao Paulo inspired in European cities, it has brought a new life to the suburb.\nFurther the pasta, it's possible to find antipastos, meat, chicken and fish - an extensive menu of typical Italian dishes. This place has been very successful on its original proposal of bringing a bit of Italy into Sao Paulo's hearth.\nA good option is the Lamb Cacciatore with \"polenta\" (cooked corn's porridge), roasted with white wine, olives and peas. One of the most requested dishes is the Conchiglia to Quadrifoglio, stuffed with four cheeses and covered with white sauce, basil, cream cheese and nuts. Well decorated and in a really Italian mood, it's a good tip for Mediterranean food admirers.\nFrom Sunday to Wednesday, 11h30am till 1am; on Thursday till 2am; on Friday and Saturday till 3am.\nSince 1992 this pub is still faithful to its original proposal: to bring Rock'N'Roll classics in Sao Paulo.\nThe bands and decor are into the 50's, 60's and 70's style, but the best of the night belongs to the drink V8. It is a secret mixture that is delivered in a flaming tray, wrapped by a special soundtrack made specially for the drink. The drink is served while the music is playing.\nThere are plenty of pictures of Marilyn Monroe, James Dean, Elvis Presley, Beatles, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison among many others. All of their songs are inside a Rock'N'Roll Jukebox where you can choose the music you like the most.", "version": "v0"}

The retailer called upon SDLC Partners to assist with the Forward Weeks of Coverage (FWOC) project. SDLC\u2019s Business Intelligence team implemented a new process to determine the necessary number of \u201ccoverage\u201d weeks handled by the current inventory processing by the client.\nA national clothing retailer was challenged by its current inventory process which was based on Weeks of Supply. Weeks of Supply is a simple calculation which projects the duration that current inventory will remain in stock. The calculation is based off the previous week\u2019s sales (Inventory / LW Actual Sales=WOS). The retailer\u2019s method of tracking inventory supply was very inefficient and outdated. For instance, many factors can play into a week\u2019s sales such as a holiday, start of a new sale/season, etc. The retailer\u2019s growing concern was that inventory of different product lines would be depleted at a slower or faster rate according to seasons of its particular sales cycle. This would directly affect the supply lines, planning and allocation, production, shipping, etc. A wrong calculation or forecast could lead to over stocking product or missed sales opportunities.\nTo gain a more accurate picture of its inventory count and reduce the risk of inventory miscalculations, the retailer needed to engage an external vendor to develop a more efficient method. SDLC\u2019s Business Intelligence team was called upon to assess the problem and develop a plan to remedy the issue in a timely manner. The recommendation was to create a data mart which pulled disparate data sources at varying levels of detail. The data would pull Current In-Store Inventory, In-transit Inventory, In-Process Inventory, Last Week\u2019s Sales, this Week\u2019s Sales, Projected Sales (13 Weeks), and expected Floorset coverage based on how much needed to be displayed in each different store/store type based on the season. The data could then be quickly pulled and analyzed to enable accurate inventory forecasts based on the individual store\u2019s needs.\nThis method enabled the client to develop a much clearer picture of their supply lines at a very low level of granularity to a high level overview painting a true picture of Forward Weeks of Coverage for each store, region, and overall company performance. This has now become the standard method of tracking inventory progress for the client.", "version": "v0"}

This method is proud of the high position accuracy.\nThe BC-2 slitter unit has a structure which not only can operate by automatically, but also can operate by manually. And mode changing can be performed by the switch button in the operation box. The slitter unit can be operated easily by a finger in the manual operation. This structure is a proprietary technology of MAYSUN, and it is effective at maintenance such as rebladings. If you switch from a manual operation to an automatic operation, the slitter unit can be returned to the specified position by the absolute position sensor. In addition, because the slitter unit uses an AC servo motor, the moving speed is optional.\nThe BC-2 slitter unit has a built-in contact pressure sensor of the strain gauge type, which be developed the first by MAYSUN in the world. By the sensor, the contact pressure of the slitter blade will be digitally displayed, and the tool-setting can be adjusted easily, too.

We can assist with additional machining if requested.\nSince there is a considerable amount setup time required to machine & install these, we can pass on a savings to you. If you can coordinate with any other customers to send a batch of motors in for machining we can offer different discounts levels. There are levels available for 2+ units, 4+ units, and 6+units.\nThe B5254T4 83mm bore 5 cylinder motors are great motors with one major caveat, they frequently crack the cylinder liners under heavy usage. This can happen on modified setups and stock setups and once it happens the entire engine block is toast.\nVolvo employed an open deck architecture when manufacturing the white block series motors which has several advantages and disadvantages compared to closed deck motors like the older red blocks.\nThe factory rotating assembly (crank, rods, and pistons) are very high quality and will support substantial power output if the block will hold up.\nThe existing two methods commonly used is shimming the cylinder liners and installing a sleeve kit. Both can work but have their drawbacks. Shimming addresses the problem indirectly by supporting the block in the weakest area but the block is still subject to the high stresses that cause the cracking. Sleeving the block is overly expensive and the cast iron used does not reject heat as well as an aluminum housed sleeve.\nThe main issues are the engines ability to handle the thermal loads and the block stiffness.\nThe B5254T4 can produce a lot of heat, especially with increased power output. Since the stock arrangement can not cope with heavy loads, it allows the materials to operate in a temperature range where they see a dramatic reduction in strength and the result is eventually the cylinder liner fatigues and cracks.\nThe open deck design allows the top of the cylinders to float and are only braced by the head gasket and the cylinder head, which is problematic at high outputs. Between the normal vibrations created in the engine and the thrust force created by the pistons during their normal stroke this will cause a situation where the location of the bore is not stable.\nWe decided to engineer and manufacture a hybrid solution between sleeving and shimming. One of the big advantages that you get with the Darton MID sleeve kit is the block receives extra bracing from the design of the sleeve. We have integrated the same approach into our kit but since our kit is made from aluminum & the factory block is made from aluminum, the thermal expansion rates will be very similar and keep the support consistent as the engine changes temperature.\nThere are cooling fins integrated into the lower half of our support which also function as stiffening ribs. Keeping an open channel at the top of the support allows coolant to flow around the area with the highest thermal load.\nThe process starts with an 11 lb bar of billet 6061-T651 aluminum that we CNC machine down to a .7 lb reinforcement plate.\nThan we take a bare cylinder block and CNC machine the water channel of the block to be able to precisely fit our reinforcement plate.\nOnce the block is machined, we apply an aerospace grade thermally conductive epoxy that mechanically and thermally bonds the reinforcement plate to the engine block. This insures that we have over 99% surface contact between the engine block and reinforcement. By filling all the minor surface variations and microvoids we can achieve a much greater thermal transfer rate from the cylinder to the guard.\nWe also shim to fit each the cylinders during the installation process.\nMilestones with the test car.\n1/13/16 Update: Over 4,000 miles have been put on the test block with a variety of driving conditions including long idling in hot weather, high boost runs, and cold starts. The setup is currently running 22 psi on a 58mm Precision turbo (~400 whp). We have seen no issues thus far.\n2/19/16 Update: Over 6,000 miles logged. Car is running 21.9 psi. Did a few dyno pulls to get a base line for tuning info. Coolant temps were also logged to check the efficiency of the block guard. Dyno results were 382 wheel hp and 327 ft lbs of torque. This was done on a very conservatively calibrated mustang dyno so we are making good power.\n3/16/16 Update: Increased pressure to 26 psi and ran out of fuel. Shopping for larger injectors and working on custom firmware package to allow for more control at higher output levels.", "version": "v0"}

You may not be having the knowledge of all languages in the world because of their different rate of complexity. Some are easy to understand while others are hard to understand, for you to know more than seven languages at a time it means you are a genius in your own way. Because of the many languages there have been the development of translation software to help translate one language to another language that you are able to understand. Some of the many benefits of using interpretation software are outlined in the article below.\nFirst, it improves communication in not one but more languages. An interpretation software helps you convey information to all your target audience regardless of whether they understand your language or not. Chances are that as a business person you will at one point have to do business with new people with a foreign language. Since the foreign people may not understand what you are saying in your language you will be forced to translate. An interpreting software breaks down the information automatically to your target audience without difficulties hence improving communication. Having an interpreting software is also cost-effective. Since an interpretation software only requires programming it is relatively cheaper than training a translator. Also when you hire translators you will have to hire a different translator for different languages which are costly.\nUsing a translation software is also cost effective as it will not charge you for the services with time. This is also beneficial for the human translators as they can use the software to help them improve and boost their translation skills. The translation software has all that is needed to translate the languages this thing that the software has can be used to help boost the translator\u2019s skills in translation. The use of translation software is also important as it ensures consistency in the translation. Since the software is not able to forget or confuse translation it is beneficial for consistency in the translation.\nUsing an interpreter software is also beneficial as it saves on time. Waiting for the interpreters to translate the language to the various many languages when in a conference is time wastage, when you use an interpreting software translation is direct the moment spoken by the speaker. Using interpreting software is time-saving. Using a translation software also helps to save on resources as you won\u2019t have to use too many resources in teaching translator. From the above advantages, you can now use interpreting software knowing what you will be expecting.", "version": "v0"}

The fact is you never really have to leave the resort. However, the Yucatan Peninsula (home to Cancun, Playa del Carmen and the Riviera Maya) has so much to offer, that you might want to get out once or twice and explore the area. Many people visit Mayan archaeological site Chichen Itza or Xcaret Park, both wonderful choices, but here are a few \u201coff the beaten track\u201d suggestions for Riviera Maya day trips.\nRuta de los Cenotes (Cenote Trail) is located in Puerto Morelos, the small fishing village that is 20 minutes south of Cancun. Cenotes are freshwater sinkholes that the Mayans considered portals to the underworld. Each one is unique and beautiful in its own way. The best way to visit Ruta de los Cenotes is to rent a car. There are countless cenotes to explore, some of which have zip-lines, hammocks and diving platforms and charge a small entrance fee.\nChichen Itza and Tulum are the most commonly visited Mayan ruins sites in the area, but at Coba, located about 60 miles east of Chichen Itza, visitors can still climb the Nohoch Mul pyramid, which is the tallest one on the Yucatan Peninsula. You\u2019ll have to climb 120 steps up 137 feet! Coba is also home to two lagoons, which are not public and can only been seen from the top of the pyramid. The best way to visit Coba is to take an organized tour or rent a car.\nTip: Wear light comfortable clothing and shoes, a hat and bring extra sun block and bottled water.\nLaguna Yal-Ku (Yal-Ku Lagoon) is a breathtaking inlet located outside the beach town of Akumal, which is about 20 miles south of Playa del Carmen. Yal-Ku\u2019s cool turquoise waters are calm which makes it ideal for snorkeling. Visitors will see several species of tropical fish and underwater limestone formations. There is a small cover charge and snorkel equipment and lockers available for rent. There is also a snack bar at Yal-Ku and lovely sculptures scattered throughout the grounds. The best way to visit Yal-Ku is to take the ADO bus to Akumal and then take a taxi to the lagoon.\nTip: Bring biodegradable sun block or snorkel in a rash guard, as regular sun block is not permitted.\nThere are many eco-parks in the Riviera Maya, but Kantun-Chi is more natural, without all the huge advertising campaigns and countless tour buses. Located about 15 miles south of Playa del Carmen, Kantun-Chi is home to four different cenotes, in which visitors can swim and snorkel. The best way to visit Kantun-Chi is to rent a car or take a taxi and arrange for the same taxi to pick you up. The entrance fee is 29 usd. 49 usd will get you a guided tour of the four cenotes and 79 usd will get you the guided tour (which includes an underground cavern) and a delicious lunch. The property is very clean and well-maintained and there are no crowds at Kantun-Chi so you\u2019ll feel like you have the place to yourself.\nTip: Snorkel equipment is not included if you do not pay for a guided tour.\nSian Ka\u2019an Biosphere Reserve is located just south of Tulum, some 40 miles south of Playa del Carmen. Made up of 1.3 million acres of pristine, natural, protected land, Sian Ka\u2019an is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is home to 23 known archaeological sites, 336 known bird species, 103 known animal species and is an important nesting site for two endangered marine turtle species. You won\u2019t find any all-inclusive resorts here, just a few small eco-friendly off-the-grid inns and private villas. Various boat, kayak and fishing tours are available through CESiaK (a non-governmental organization). The best way to visit Sian Ka\u2019an is to take a tour.\nTip: If you choose to rent a car and visit Sian Ka\u2019an on your own, rent a 4\u00d74 as the unpaved road is quite bumpy.\nTell us about your favorite off-the-beaten-path place in the Riviera Maya in the comments below.", "version": "v0"}

Are there any justifiable restrictions on freedom of association? In my book, any restriction on one's right to associate freely with anyone he pleases, on mutually agreeable terms, is both offensive and a gross violation of human rights. Let's think about it, starting with a couple of examples from the past.\nIn 1958, two Virginia residents -- Mr. Loving, a white man, and Mildred Jeter, a black woman -- traveled to Washington, D.C., to marry. Upon return to Virginia, they were charged with and found guilty of violation of Virginia's anti-miscegenation laws. In 1967, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Loving vs. Virginia, held that laws banning interracial marriages violated the equal protection and due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The couple's conviction was reversed. Aside from Virginia's anti-miscegenation laws having violated the Constitution, it also violated the basic human right of freedom of association.\nLet's now ask whether Virginia's laws would have been more acceptable if instead of banning interracial marriages, it mandated interracial marriages? I'd find such a law just as offensive, and for the same reason: It would violate freedom of association.\nThere's another case we might look at. H.L. Mencken, writing in the Nov. 9, 1948, Baltimore Evening Sun, brought to light that the City's Park Board had a regulation forbidding white and black citizens from playing tennis with each other in public parks. Today, most Americans, I suspect would find such a regulation an offensive attack on freedom of association. I imagine that most would find it just as offensive if the regulation had required blacks and whites to play tennis with one another. It would also violate freedom of association.\nWhile Americans would agree there should be freedom of association in the specific cases of marriage and tennis, what about freedom of association as a general principle? Suppose men formed a club, a professional association or any other private association, and women wanted to be members. Is there any case for forcing them to admit women? Or, what if it were white men who formed a private association -- is there any case for forcing them to admit blacks to membership? The same question can be asked in reverse: What if it were women or blacks who formed an association. Should they be forced to admit men or whites? Wouldn't forced membership in any of these cases violate freedom of association?\nWhat if you wanted to deal with me, but I didn't want to deal with you?\nYou say: \"I'm stuck with that one, Williams. What do you mean?\"\nSuppose I'm looking to hire an employee. You show up for the job, but I don't want to deal with you. My reasons might be that you're white, you're a Catholic, you're ugly, you're a woman or anything else about you that I find objectionable. Should I be forced to hire you?\nYou say, \"Williams, that's illegal employment discrimination.\" You're right, but it still has to do with freedom of association -- and either you're for or against freedom of association as a general principle.\nYou might argue that I should hire or deal with the first qualified person who comes along. In terms of freedom of association, that's nonsense. After all, would you say I should marry the first qualified women who comes along or play tennis with the first qualified person, or should I be free to marry or play tennis with people I like?\nThe bottom line is that the true test of one's commitment to freedom of association doesn't come when he allows people to associate in ways he approves. The true test of that commitment comes when he allows people to be free to voluntarily associate in ways he deems despicable. Forced association is not freedom of association.", "version": "v0"}

The developed equity markets of America, UK and Europe have all rallied approximately 10% from the lows of mid September. They do however remain below the heights from earlier in the year. The reason for the sell-off, the US would raise rates just as the fears were growing of a Chinese economic hard landing leading to a global economic recession, are well documented.\nThese fears appear to have subsided for now, the US did not raise interest rates, the Chinese economy may be slowing but perhaps not as fast as feared and this week Mario Draghi intimated that the ECB might add further stimulus. The bears will continue to argue their case, however the equity market picture remains finely balanced.\nEquity markets were not the only risk asset class to have a good week. High yield debt saw inflows with the performance positive as risk outperformed quality. The top performing asset classes were emerging market equity followed by US high yield.\nThe big move in the currency market was post the ECB meeting on Thursday as the euro weakened about 3%. The question is now has this move by the ECB strengthened the case for a rate rise by the Fed in December or weakened it? On the one hand it could be said the ECB have done the Fed\u2019s work as the dollar rallied, on the other the additional liquidity the ECB could provide may soften the blow any move the Fed might make.\nWe have covered earnings in our mid week blogs, the picture was improved at the end of the week by Microsoft, Amazon and Google after the disappointment of Caterpillar. Factset records that with about one third of the S&P 500 companies having reported, the blended earnings decline is 3.8%, slightly ahead of expectations.\nLooking to the week ahead earnings will remain in focus, as more blue chips will report. BATS, BP, Comcast and Ford on Tuesday will make some headlines.\nMacro will be dominated on Tuesday by the US durable goods orders data for September, as well as the latest consumer confidence report. Wednesday will be the big day as the Federal Reserve decides whether the timing is now right to move on interest rates. A move this week would definitely take the markets by surprise. On Thursday q3 GDP for the US economy, expectations are for the economy to grow by 2.5% for the third quarter year on year. Likewise on Tuesday we get the preliminary estimates for UK Q3 GDP, expectations are similar for a similar growth number than that of the US, around 2.5%. For Europe the focus will probably be Thursday and Friday. Thursday we get business and consumer confidence as well as economic sentiment. On Friday we get the latest employment and inflation rate for the eurozone, these figures may have some bearing on what the ECB do in September.\nPosted on October 25, 2015 by Paul Sedgwick.", "version": "v0"}

Among the most important changes was a reduction in the number of days one must be physically present in Canada as a permanent resident before applying for citizenship.\nBefore the changes, citizenship applicants had to have accumulated four years (1,460 days) of physical presence in Canada out of a six-year period as permanent residents. For eligibility, applicants are now only required to have counted three years (1,095 days) out of a five year period.\nIRCC further reports that there has been a 40 percent rise in new Canadian citizenship acquisitions over the 12 month period since the October 2017 changes, compared to a similar period last year.\nWhen summed up, the total number of citizenship applications over the nine-month period following the revision also shot up to 242,680, a 130 percent increase from 102,261 applications over a similar period before the changes.\nAnother major amendment is the right for an individual who had spent time in Canada on work, study or as a temporary resident before acquiring permanent residency to count up to 365 days as part of their physically present days. However, each day spent in Canada in such a status is actually counted as a half day.\nThe age requirement for applicants to prove ability for language and knowledge prerequisites for citizenship was also reduced to the 18-54 years bracket from 14-64 years bracket.\nWhile marking the Citizenship Week that runs from October 8 to 14, Ahmed Hussein, Canada\u2019s Immigration Minister praised the new changes to citizenship rules, as having made the process fairer, faster and more accessible.", "version": "v0"}

Are conferencing sessions improving the collaborative efforts and brainstorming results of your executives, managers, supervisors, employees and remote contractors? Ensure if your current solutions are working well by getting the feedback of your employees and participating customers. Also, identify certain departments in your organization that can greatly benefit from conferencing services. Determine how they can use it to its fullest advantage. If your intent is to hold online meetings, webcasting, and webinars, then it\u2019s likely for you to require conferencing services.\nCost \u2013 Appropriate conferencing solutions might be more costly than what you really need to pay. Some come with all needed features on top of various bells and whistles that aren\u2019t that necessary, making these generally quite expensive. So, carefully review the cost of purchasing all equipment that you require for your exact needs. Also keep in mind other recurring expenses, such as IT administration, maintenance and support costs. Many providers of online conferencing hosting solutions are ready to work with you. Some offer attractive pricing plans like per minute charging, enterprise licenses and monthly or annual subscriptions. Review their quotes, choosing ones that can best suit the conferencing needs of your business.\nCustomer Support \u2013 A reliable conferencing system should be bundled with extensive customer care. This will make it quicker and easier for you to resolve issues with your conferencing system. Additionally, this can boost employee education and help in anchoring up the system as quickly and seamlessly as possible. With this, carefully study the bundled customer support services offered by your chosen conferencing provider. Are their customer support services provided through their third party contractor, or via their on-site resources? Do they have live operators? What training do they offer? Is it free or paid? Do they provide an operator help services? Reliable customer support will make it easy to use a web conferencing system. This can in turn increase web conferencing utility for the executives, managers, supervisors, employees, remote contractors and participating clients of your business.\nConferencing Components \u2013 Perform a thorough evaluation of the components that you really need for your conferencing system. Complex components might be unnecessary, and identifying these things can significantly reduce the overall cost of your conferencing solution. Also, keep in mind that certain on-site conferencing solutions provide modular options, which simply means you can select which components to plug into your servers. This gives your tech guys the granularity they need in terms of choosing the ideal components for your system. Remember, they need to factor in the training time and resources they need to teach your other personnel on how to properly use your conferencing system, and integrating complex components can make this a more challenging task for them.\nSecurity & Scalability \u2013 An excellent conferencing system should provide room for expansion. The more that people want to use it will mean rescaling conferencing components. When selecting a conferencing system, choose a certain type that would be more likely to support the future needs of your business. This will help you avoid unnecessarily investing too much resources just to shift to an entirely new web conferencing provider. Security is also an important factor when choosing a conferencing provider. It should be high priority for any business to select a secure conferencing provider from the get go. Most free conferencing services are just integrated with regular security protocols. This might not be a robust solution for you, especially if your business data is on the line. You\u2019re recommended to get a hosted conferencing solution with industry standard security. Carefully considering these factors can enable you to properly select the best conferencing provider. Remember, it is vital to determine your current needs and budget, and the type of support that your staff needs to take advantage of the benefits that conferencing can provide your organization. After all, a conferencing system is more than a business tool because your chosen provider is also a communication partner of your business.", "version": "v0"}

I\u2019ve been busy.\nJust before the 2014/15 season of the Coastal Sounds Community Choir, my wife (and fellow Artistic Director) and I decided that it was time to grow our little organization into one that could service the singing needs of more people. This included more permanent projects for different demographics, and building on our \u201coccasional\u201d projects so that people could take part in activities that didn\u2019t require a night of their week all year round.\nThus, we evolved into the Coastal Sounds Choir Association.\nOne of the CSCA\u2019s biggest benefits is its locality. The Town of Conception Bay South has a very strong artistic community (music, dance and visual art), helped along by a plethora of music schools, dance studios and other community-based programs. Considering it\u2019s the second largest municipality in all of Newfoundland, it\u2019s a great pleasure to offer musical activities to the local residents to save them the trouble of travelling to St. John\u2019s or farther (even though St. John\u2019s is only 20 minutes away, folks really love to stay in their town, hence all the schools and studios).\nThe plan was to build on the recent success of two new projects that were done in the past two years. The first is the Christmas Cantata Project, which premiered in 2013 with just my own singers from Coastal Sounds and Topsail United Church, and then was opened up to all interested singers the surrounding areas in 2014. We\u2019re now on our third Cantata and it\u2019s become one of the most popular parts of the musical year in CBS, for both concert-goers and singers. Singers enjoy the opportunity to take part in a \u201cspread-out\u201d rehearsal schedule (this year, over five Saturdays) because it can be difficult to commit to another weekly activity, especially for those who work long days or have young families. The Christmas Cantata Project has received such positive feedback that we intend to keep it an annual tradition for our Christmas concert.\nThe second is our Summer Music Program, which was originally organized by just Beth and I, but was rolled under the umbrella of the CSCA during the expansion. Over the past two Augusts, we have held an Adult Choir Camp for singers who wanted to receive an accelerated choral education but could also not commit all year long to a permanent choir. The program accepts singers of all musical backgrounds (like the Coastal Sounds Community Choir, our flagship project) and aims to just get people singing, to get them interested and show them just how much fun it can be. The Adult program continues to grow year after year and we hope that we can expand it to youth in 2016.\nAnd finally, we created a second permanent project, the Aurora Women\u2019s Choir. We held auditions for interested members in September 2014 and started with 19 singers. This year, we\u2019re up to 28. Even though the choir\u2019s only been together for just over a year, they\u2019ve had wonderful growth in both capability and opportunity. Aurora won a Gold Standard at the 2015 St. John\u2019s Rotary Music Festival and in July 2016, they have been invited to represent the province at the UNISONG Choral Festival in Ottawa. It\u2019s awesome to think that we\u2019re only getting started and the more repertoire research I do, the more excited I get about all the wonderful music there is for women\u2019s choir. After working in Barbershop and men\u2019s voices for a decade, it felt right to explore the other side of things as well.\nWe rebranded this year (a HUGE thank you to WaterWerks Communications for their hard work) and I invite you to our website to check it all out. One main focus for growth in 2016 is a new project called the Con Fuoco Youth Choir. This choir is intended to be a comprehensive choral education for young singers aged 12-18. Auditions will be scheduled soon so watch our website and Like our Facebook page to stay up to date.\nIt\u2019s been an incredible year and I am overjoyed at the idea of getting more people involved in choral singing. It has obviously changed my life and will change yours, too. Come to our 2015 Annual Holiday Concert and see all the smiles for yourself.\nWhile studying my Masters, I started teaching for The Music Corner, a newly opened music school in Manuels, which is a township of Conception Bay South. In 2006, I discussed with the owners about starting some kind of group singing opportunity through the school. The idea from the beginning was to offer a classroom setting that would be more of a \u201cgroup voice lesson\u201d, using the choral context as the medium for delivery. Concerts and recitals would happen, but they would be less important than just getting people singing and teaching them to sing well.\nAlong with The Music Corner, my wife and I started Coastal Sounds (originally called the CBS Community Choir) in January 2007. On the very first night, we had eight people. I really had no idea how many would show up or what the backgrounds of the singers would be. I had prepared Locus Iste from a choral conducting book and an SATB arrangement of The Water Is Wide. Locus Iste was a bit of a disaster (do NOT throw Latin at untrained singers as the first lesson, TRUST me) but the other arrangement ended up being a great first success for the group.\nThe choir started in unison and slowly built it out into three parts. Because we had so few men in the beginning (in fact, I only had around six guys in the group until a couple of years ago) it was hard to find choral music that included them but didn\u2019t overtax them. Thus began my life long love of the SAB context. I\u2019ve come to realize that SAB repertoire is often underrated and a powerful tool to make group singing happen without too much effort.\nWe slowly built out The Water Is Wide in three of the four parts. This also taught me a lot about how to plan for three parts in the future. Even in most Level 1 and 2 SATB arrangements, you can sing SAT and the piano will cover the bass notes. I highly recommend using SAB for your community choirs and a lot of SATB arrangements will also have three part, two part or unison alternatives. I continue to use SAB arrangements on a regular basis because they ease the amount of rehearsal time necessary for part singing, and give the men a realistic goal to achieve.\nCoastal Sounds amicably broke off into its own non-profit organization three years ago and has continued to grow every year. We now have almost 50 regular members, sing at least two concerts a year, with many more exciting ideas on the horizon for expansion. I teach almost everything by singing and modelling, and I\u2019ll get into more detail about this method in a later post.\nThe choir has always been available to anyone who has an interest in singing. We have members from many different musical backgrounds. Not everyone reads but the blend of experience with non-experience amongst singers has provided more teaching support that I could have ever anticipated. Those who know more help the ones who don\u2019t. We still bill it as a group voice lesson with no harsh expectation on performance but the choir continues to get better and more capable with each passing season.\nC) They should only \u201cmouth the words\u201d and not make any sound whatsoever.\nI\u2019m not exaggerating when I say that among the vast majority of the people I have taught in Coastal Sounds, someone in their past, directly or indirectly, robbed them of something incredibly important; a lifelong love of making music.\nA little tangent. I first met Dr. Doug Dunsmore, now retired professor of choral activities at MUN, in the summer of 2004 at the Sing Summer Adult Choir Camp sponsored by the Nova Scotia Choral Federation. Of all the wonderful things I came to learn from Doug over the next 10 years, perhaps the most \u2018infamous\u2019 one was that he is a lover of sayings; short musical parables that continuously resound over and over, sometimes to the point of polite ribbing from his singers. He has a bunch of them, some of them are even a bit comical, but there\u2019s one, the \u2018golden rule\u2019, that came to impact me in a very profound way.\nThis echoed because it spoke directly to me and my experience. I had not been a choral singer for very long. Thanks to many great opportunities from 2003 to 2005 in Nova Scotia, I quickly developed enough skills to participate in more challenging music by just doing it as much as I could. Repetition, repetition, repetition. My world quickly became consumed by choir. Meeting Doug was really the turning point for my career. Watching how much fun he had with the singers, along with the positive experiences that I had while conducting, gave me the motivation to make choir and choral conducting my passion.\nNow, back to Coastal Sounds. If we hold \u201cDoug\u2019s Rule\u201d to be correct (which I\u2019m living proof that it is), the only missing piece is the amount of time and effort on the part of the singer, and the amount of encouragement and patience on the part of the teacher. After the first few times of being told the same horrible story from a member\u2019s past, I vowed early that I would do whatever I could to encourage anyone to sing who were willing to make a commitment to learn.\nOf all these \u2018misfits\u2019 who have come to our island to sing over the past 7 years, less than 5% of them have had what society would call \u2018tonedeafness\u2019, which is a term I personally hate, because I\u2019ve come to learn it\u2019s actually false. I have come to discover with my private teaching that these individuals actually possess remarkable ability in audiation, but in most cases, there are so many physical barriers (nervousness, upper body tension, poor breath support) that the singer is just completely incapable of phonating the pitch they\u2019re audiating. I have worked with two singers for the past number of months who have come to Coastal Sounds but were having pitch matching problems, and with enough training and muscle development, they are finding way more success than they ever had before. I tell all my private students that from the beginner all the way up to the professional, going to a private music lesson is like going to the gym. Sometimes, no matter how much you \u2018know\u2019 something, you need to work it out for it to grow. Corrective repetition.\nThere are a few other simple factors that create success in Coastal Sounds. Because I do have singers who can read and follow their lines, they end up singing a bit more confidently than the others. While singing in three parts, the right answer in any given part is always present in some capacity. I regularly encourage my singers to become better listeners as well. Take a person who comes in convinced that they would never sing, sit them next to a person who can sing the part, and once the tension of having to sing alone wears off, they succeed brilliantly. Most of the time it\u2019s \u2018chickenissimo\u2019 (another Dougism) at first because they lack confidence, but the fact remains that they can do it.\nAll I do as the director of Coastal Sounds is to show people how easy singing can be (once you know a few simple rules on how to do it well), give them the experience that they can indeed sing, and encourage them when they do it correctly. With this simple methodology, I have seen the blossoming of incredible amateur musicians who genuinely have a love for what they\u2019re doing. To think that so many of these people lived DECADES carrying around the curse of belief that they could not sing only motivates me to help as many more people as I can.\nI have never put too much impetus or pressure on the performances we do. No matter how well I can get something to sound in rehearsal, the spectre of self doubt is still alive and strong in many people. Although I continue to give them positive experience after positive experience in concert, there are those who will always be plagued with stage fright. But even with the occasional \u2018improvisation\u2019 from the choir, the looks on everyone\u2019s faces are the true truthtellers. Coastal Sounds members have fun making music. And in the end, isn\u2019t that the most important thing of all?\nI said in my last post that I wouldn\u2019t list any specific NL choir for fear of forgetting someone, but you\u2019ll have to indulge me a little bragging about my own amazing choir families (\u201clike you would\u201d, as the Newfoundlanders say). My bias may be showing but singing in the Quintessential Vocal Ensemble has given me some of the best musical experiences of my life. And on May 24, 2014, it gave me the greatest of them all (so far, anyway).\nBack about a year ago, our gregarious and fearless leader, Susan Quinn, was invited to bring QVE down to New York City for a MidAmerica Productions concert. Susan had her Carnegie Hall debut in 2010 when she conducted Vivaldi\u2019s Gloria for MidAmerica. In agreeing to participate in another mass choir/orchestral offering, Susan was granted a half hour spot on this concert for QVE alone. Needless to say that once we learned this, we were bouncing off the walls with excitement. Fundraisers and plans began immediately.\nWith over 200 voices, a children\u2019s choir, soloists and the New England Symphonic Ensemble, the mass work we performed was \u201cTo Be Certain Of The Dawn\u201d, a Holocaust memorial oratorio by Stephen Paulus with libretto by Michael Dennis Browne. The work was challenging but very musically rewarding.\nThe original plan of this concert was to sing the \u201cSunrise Mass\u201d by Ola Gjello which the choir was excited about at first because we had recently performed it back in 2012. Here\u2019s a few highlights from us singing it.\nThe last two pieces were both by Canadian composer Leonard Enns, the first being \u201cAs On Wings\u201d, a newly commissioned work by QVE commemorating the Newfoundland connection to 9/11, and more specifically, the involvement of Holy Heart High School, where Susan has been the music teacher for many years.\nI \u2026 saw these huge planes coming, one at a time, through the Narrows and I thought how after hundreds of years people are still seeking the shelter of our harbour.\nThe second Enns piece was \u201cTe Deum Brevis\u201d and Susan generously gave me the life changing opportunity to conduct this piece in Carnegie Hall. As excited as the choir was about going, it was all I could do to contain my own excitement as the date got closer. Since joining in 2012, I have conducted them in performance a couple of times and working with them has been incredibly influential in my development as a conductor. Here is a video from my YouTube channel of me conducting them through Whitacre\u2019s \u201cA Boy And A Girl\u201d.\nLeonard graciously came to the concert and even worked with us on the Friday evening before. It was awesome that he was there to share it with us, along with many of our family and friends.\nOnce we got into the hall the first time on Saturday for a dress rehearsal, we were all immediately astonished by the acoustics. They can only be described as \u2018perfect\u2019. The stage forms into a bowl shape and as you can see from the above photo, we were able to stand in our normal formation and you could hear everything. To give you an idea of what I mean by perfect, in between one phrase I remember, many members of the choir collectively swallowed and you could hear it clear as day. But as we sang, you could also hear every member of the choir clear as day as well. We blended together beautifully because unlike most of the venues back home, everyone could hear everyone else. Like I said, perfect.\nAfter a great dress rehearsal, we were on pins and needles until the curtain time finally came. Being led onto the most famous stage in North America to a nearly full house was a truly surreal experience. The performance was incredible. We sang as well as we possibly could and the audience awarded us with a standing ovation along with the loud cheers of those who had come so far to see us sing.\nWhen I stepped out of the choir to conduct the Enns, I was not nervous at all. I was filled with nothing but trust that I had done everything I could to prepare them and that they would absolutely kill it like the professionals they are. I was not to be disappointed.\nI knew the question was coming but it wasn\u2019t until days after the concert that I was finally able to form a cogent response.\nIt was as close to God as I\u2019ve ever been.\nIn order to explain what I mean by this, you need to know just a little about the \u2018religious\u2019 me. Without getting too boring and technical, my main metaphysical viewpoint in life is that we are all sharing energy with each other everywhere we go. Good energy and bad energy. I heard John Leguizamo on TV the other day refer to it as a \u201csoul exchange\u201d.\nI\u2019m going to give you a little piece of my soul tonight, and if you give me a little piece of yours and we do this right, we\u2019re going to have a soul exchange right here on this stage.\nWhen I\u2019m with my choir in church, I get the honour of helping people participate in their own personal worship every week through the power of music. You can feel the energy being sent upward by everyone. You can then feel it rain gently and mildly back down on all of us. I find prayer can be a very real force in the world if looked upon as simply the generation of positive energy. Not to mention the powerful energy I get from my choir as I lead them to share their gifts with the congregation.\nThe energy amongst QVE was high the minute we landed in NYC and grew exponentially with each passing day. As I was conducting them, I felt the choir releasing that pent-up energy like white hot blazing arcs of lightning, hitting me all at once. It was overwhelming. It was the greatest high I\u2019d ever experienced as a musician. I felt myself outside of my body and floating inside the music. Gestures flew out of me that I had not known were possible. At the end I threw my hands up in the air because I wanted to hear the last chord of the piece ring in those beautiful acoustics as long as I could. It was an intense few minutes to say the least.\nAfterwards, as we were leaving the stage, I wept inconsolably for a good 10 minutes. I had shared more energy at once than ever before in my life. I can only describe it as a religious experience, something that cannot be put into words or quantified with measurement. It changed me irrevocably. In those few moments, I truly felt like a conduit for the choir to share their pride and talent with the audience and I can\u2019t thank them enough for allowing me to share that with them.\nThis trip would not have been as successful without the awe-inspiring talent that is the Quintessential Vocal Ensemble, and our dear leader, Susan Quinn. Susan has inspired me in so many ways as a singer, conductor and teacher. I owe her everything for giving me this privilege and QVE is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.\nI love you, QVE. You\u2019re the best.\nWe took this selfie just after walking off stage from our brilliant performance. Ellen, eat your heart out.\nHello, my dear friends. My name is Andrew Cranston and I welcome you to my new website and blog. I am a choral conductor, singer, music teacher and clinician living in St. John\u2019s, Newfoundland and Labrador, along with having an active life as a music teacher in Conception Bay South, a growing community just outside of the city.\nAlthough my musical career began with the saxophone, once I graduated with my Bachelor\u2019s degree I began working more and more with choirs almost immediately. After attending my first Sing Summer camp, organized by the Nova Scotia Choral Federation, I knew I was hooked for life. At Sing Summer, I also learned about the Masters in Choral Conducting program at Memorial University where I studied until 2007. Once I had finished, my wife and I had fallen in love with Newfoundland and wished to stay and lay down our musical roots.\nNow, almost eight years later, we have an incredibly active life as a conductor and accompanist team, as the Co-Founders of the Coastal Sounds Community Choir in 2007 and working with our choirs at Topsail United Church since 2013, where my wife is the organist. In addition to the choirs I conduct with my wife, I also direct the Anchormen Chorus, a men\u2019s barbershop group in St. John\u2019s, and sing with the award winning Quintessential Vocal Ensemble under the direction of Susan Quinn.\nI maintain an active private music instruction studio in both St. John\u2019s and Conception Bay South which you can find out more about by clicking here.\nI had the immense benefit of an amazing public school music education all throughout my grade schooling. Through the support of my parents and the band teacher at my junior high school, I fell in love with music and I fell hard. It became my obsession almost instantly and continues to be until this very day. That band teacher personally moulded me, took interest in me. He gave me solos, encouraged me to contact other musicians, and just showed me how amazing being a musician could be. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since, but I wish I could tell him how formative he was in my career.\nBut that was the saxophone. For 12 straight years, all I did was play the saxophone. I got pretty good at it. The only major singing I did was being in our only high school musical in our era, and singing in the Vocal Jazz Ensemble at Mount Allison University. Don\u2019t get me wrong, those singing experiences were awesome, but they didn\u2019t pull me in any specific way.\nThen, when I graduated and the saxophone was beginning to lose its lustre both literally and figuratively, I found choir, rather randomly by contacting folks who were organizing a men\u2019s choir for Nova Scotia, which would later become Nova Voce and is still active (I saw them sing at Podium in May and they are still as vibrant as ever). Choir pulled me towards it, for many reasons, the most important of which was the people. I loved interacting with people and sharing the music with them. It wasn\u2019t just me in a dark, dingy practice room anymore, I found myself part of a special community. Through the work of the Nova Scotia Choral Federation, I found even more amazing people, educators and singers and music lovers, and they encouraged me to walk the path I\u2019m walking now.\nI was not really a naturally good singer. I had an okay ear from good teachers and a natural thirst to teach others, plus I did enjoy it, but my voice was very raw in the beginning. Untrained. But as I said, choir pulled me in. So I sang, and sang, and sang. And sang some more. And I watched conductors do awe inspiring things with amazing singers, desiring more and more to emulate their brilliance. I got better and better. The famous writer Malcolm Gladwell, author of a great book called \u201cOutliers\u201d says that in order to be successful at something, all you need is a interest and 10,000 hours. I feel like I\u2019m now just hitting my 10,000 and I couldn\u2019t be more in love with what I do.\nTo conduct a choir of mostly untrained singers like I once was, some of whom were told at very young ages that they would never be able to sing and they should \u201cmouth the words\u201d, and to give them an important experience that they were robbed of their entire lives because of bad influences, has been the greatest training I could have ever asked for. As a singer in QVE and with other choirs in the past, I have had the privilege to be part of some of the very best choral singing in Canada or even the world. Perfection at the upper echelon of the choral art. And although we should continue to strive for those highest of heights, we must not forget our roots. We all started somewhere. I find great rewards in helping those who would otherwise not be singing if it weren\u2019t for choirs like Coastal Sounds, who include all regardless of background. My choir may occasionally be rough around the edges, but the looks in the faces of every last singer lets me know we\u2019re part of yet another special community. We must celebrate all forms of singing.\nI hope you\u2019ll join me on this blog so I can tell you my choir stories in the hopes that you\u2019ll go make some stories of your own. It\u2019s the greatest non-contact (mostly) team sport on the planet. Give choir a try; you could even come and sing in one of mine. Maybe you have just enough piano or guitar skills, and leadership skills to start a choir of your own, especially in those dark voids where no choirs exist. I can\u2019t recommend it enough. It will change your life. It changed mine.\nPS: I highly recommend marrying your accompanist. For a multitude of reasons.", "version": "v0"}

Operating revenues, defined as net interest income after loan loss provision plus noninterest income, decreased by 7% to $13.3 million compared to $14.3 million in the second quarter of 2007.\nThe decrease in operating revenues was largely related to net interest margin compression of 87 basis points to 3.34% from 4.21% during the second quarter of 2007 due to the 325 basis point decrease in interest rates that has occurred since September 2007. Offsetting the margin compression was a 28% increase in average loans to $1.1 billion compared to the second quarter of 2007, following the Cardinal State Bank merger which closed on March 31, 2008. Also impacting operating revenues was an $878,000 increase in the loan loss provision to $1.1 million compared to $200,000 during the second quarter of 2007. The higher provision resulted from a combination of loan growth associated with the Cardinal State Bank acquisition, an increased level of nonperforming assets, and a softening of economic conditions across the company's financial markets.\nThe decrease in net income during the second quarter of 2008 was primarily due to a 17% increase in expenses compared to the second quarter of 2007, reflecting the first full quarter of expenses following the Cardinal merger as well as start-up costs associated with the New England expansion of Sidus. Excluding one-time merger-related expenses, second quarter 2008 net income was $2.4 million, representing diluted earnings per share of $0.21. One-time, merger-related expenses totaled approximately $330,000 in salaries and benefits as well as data processing expenses. Start-up costs associated with the New England expansion of Sidus totaled $97,000 during the quarter.\nBill Long, President and CEO, commented, \"We continued to benefit from strong asset quality. For example, nonperforming loans were 0.43% of loans, a slight improvement from the prior quarter, and net charge-offs were 0.14% of average loans. Thanks to the sound decisions and integrity of our experienced management team, Yadkin Valley continues to perform well in the current challenging economic environment.\n\"The Cardinal merger is off to a great start. Loans at Cardinal increased 5%, while deposits increased 7% compared to the first quarter of 2008. The rapidly growing market area in and around Durham will be a key source for long term growth, and the newly opened Hillsborough and Creedmoor offices in this region have already been successful in generating new loans and deposits. During the first half of this year, we have replaced several loan officers with three seasoned commercial lenders within this new key market, and they have already begun to contribute to loan and deposit growth.\n\"We are seeing a significant opportunity at Sidus, our mortgage lending subsidiary, as customers seeking trust and stability have returned to the banks for their mortgages. Sidus successfully entered six New England states in April, and we expect these new markets to fuel a significant part of Sidus' volumes during the second half of 2008. The housing downturn has had a modest effect on Sidus' business, as it reported record production and profitability, including the New England start-up costs, during the first six months of 2008.\n\"Lending policies and procedures and credit quality will remain the key areas on which we will continue to concentrate during the remainder of 2008 and into 2009. We have recently improved our past due and risk grade reporting processes, which has resulted in better information flow and management control of the loan portfolio. We are in the process of strengthening our credit administration and review processes, with both structure and resources, which will allow us to better manage credit approvals and renewals.\n\"We remain confident in our ability to manage our bank through this difficult and volatile environment. There are several metrics on which we base this optimism. First, we believe that our net interest margin has bottomed during the second quarter of 2008, and expect it to expand over the next two quarters as 48% of our CDs reprice at lower rates. Secondly, we anticipate cost savings related to the Cardinal transaction, to be in the range of $750,000, over the second half of 2008, which should positively impact operating expenses. We do recognize that our asset quality may deteriorate slightly during the second half of the year. Nevertheless, for the remainder of 2008, we believe that Yadkin Valley will outperform the industry average recorded in the second quarter, which showed nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans at 1.01% and median net charge off ratio of 0.31%.\"\nNet interest income was $10.4 million, compared to $10.4 million in the second quarter of 2007. Net interest income was supported by an increase of 28% in average loans to $1.1 billion from $859 million as of June 30, 2007. The significant increase in average loans is largely attributed to the Cardinal State Bank acquisition. Offsetting the increase in average loans was a decrease in the net interest margin of 87 basis points to 3.34% from 4.21% as of the second quarter of 2007, and a decrease of 22 basis points from 3.56% as of the first quarter of 2008. The year-over-year decrease in the net interest margin was due to the rapid 325 basis points drop in interest rates that occurred since September of 2007, which had a more immediate effect upon variable rate loans. The sequential decrease in the net interest margin was primarily related to the 25 basis point interest rate decrease that took affect in April, as well as Cardinal's balance sheet mix and the intense competitive environment for deposits. As of the second quarter of 2008, variable rate loans accounted for approximately 50% of total loans.\nNon-interest income of $4.0 million decreased by 2% compared to $4.1 million in the second quarter of 2007. The decrease reflects lower service fees, income related to bank owned life insurance, and mortgage banking income. These decreases were offset by higher service charges, and net gains on mortgage loan sales due to a one-time accounting change that took effect during the first quarter of 2008. Compared to the first quarter 2008, non-interest income increased by 3% due to increases across most non-interest income categories.\nNon-interest expense increased by 17% to $10.2 million, compared to $8.7 million in the second quarter of 2007 and by 18% compared to the first quarter 2008. The year-over-year and sequential increases were largely due to higher salary and benefits expenses and data processing expenses, reflecting the first full quarter of operations which included the Cardinal State Bank acquisition. Start-up costs associated with Sidus's New England expansion amounted to $234,000 ($137,000 in the first quarter and $97,000 in the second quarter), and operating efficiency is expected to improve over the next several quarters as new loan volume increases.\nTotal gross loans increased $266.3 million, or 31% compared to the second quarter of 2007, due to loans acquired in connection with the Cardinal State Bank acquisition. Loans increased $30.5 million or 3% compared to the first quarter of 2008, primarily due to growth in commercial loans across most of the Company's markets.\nDeposits increased $154.2, or 16% compared to the second quarter of 2007. The year-over-year increase in deposits was primarily due to deposits acquired in connection with the Cardinal acquisition. Compared to the first quarter of 2008, deposits decreased $15.7 million or 1%, primarily due to a slight runoff of higher cost CDs that were replaced with lower cost short-term borrowings. The Company continues to rely primarily on home-grown deposits to fund its loan growth, as brokered CDs represented only 2% of total deposits, compared to negligible amounts in the second quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2008.\nDuring the second quarter of 2008, net charge-offs totaled 0.14% of average loans, compared to 0.01% during the second quarter of 2007 and a net recovery of 0.01% during the first quarter of 2008. The provision covered net charge-offs by 281% in the second quarter of 2008, and reserves as a percentage of loans held for investment increased to 1.42%, compared to 1.32% in the second quarter of 2007 and 1.40% in the first quarter of 2008.\nThe bank remains well-capitalized for regulatory purposes. The total capital ratio was 10.62%, tier one ratio was 9.37%, and leverage ratio was 8.43% (at the bank level) as of the second quarter of 2008. This compares to a total capital ratio of 10.68%, tier one ratio of 9.48%, and leverage ratio of 8.26% as of the second quarter of 2007. Tangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets was 6.63%, compared to 8.29% compared to the same period in 2007 and 6.80% during the first quarter of 2008.\nearning assets and interest expense.\nincome divided by total average earning assets.\nYadkin Valley Financial will host a webcast at 2 p.m. EDT to discuss second quarter 2008 financial results.

Let's start with positives!\nIn IP behavior can be buried in piles of code; not in CDP.\nIP doesn't enforce any particular restraint on programmer's thought process or program organization. He is free to write any code as long as it captures the desired behaviors. Yet the resulting code, although functional, is often cryptic and mixes behaviors in a way that's hard to parse and organize to human mind. Moreover, there is no easy way to explore and understand the program by shallow inspection due to lack of any per-behavior organization.\nTake the slider in the Parables of the Polygons page, which is used to set the bias level of a shape. Where is the piece of code that's responsible for making such functionality?\nNow we have identified the code responsible for this behavior. But there was no indication anywhere. After all, these are just lines of code like many other thousands of lines of code in this application.\nAlso note that, despite being an elaborate demo, the set of behavior types are relatively short (7-8) as we see in the graphic above. This can be contrasted to many hundreds and thousands of \"lines of code\" which make an imperative program.\nCDP induces a \"linear\" thinking process in designing, implementing, and exploring programs; IP results in \"ad hoc\" way of doing those.\nCDP model forces the programmer to think and design the program as a set of individual behaviors. Once the set of behaviors are defined (as constraint types), building a program is simply a matter applying a selection of them to the data. Again, the list of behaviors is clearly acknowledged and alternation of behaviors can be done by selecting and mixing and matching.\nBy contrast, in IP the process is quite ad hoc. The programmer keeps a mental list of things that needs to be done for the program. She then proceeds to write the \"code\" that implements those things. In the lack of any organization or guidelines, this code often makes no attempt to keep the behaviors separable and modularized. It may try to use the same \"loop\" construct to achieve goals A and B at the same time, etc. The lack of direction and organization can also confuse the thinking process itself, leading to bugs. Although the final outcome succeeds in achieving all desired behaviors, it too often fails to be amenable to extensions or facilitating understanding. In CDP, extension and modifying is a matter of reshuffling set of constraints, whereas in IP often algorithms need to be reworked.\nCDP model reduces the possibility of bugs.\nIn the CDP model, all constraints act on the same state in parallel, assuming each one is the only one trying to make a change. There is a separate later process that consolidates those changes into one final result. In IP, however, the same code is used to implement multiple behaviors. Therefore, each snippet of code that aims to achieve a particular behavior sees a different state, as our programs run sequentially. This complicates human reasoning and increases the chance of introducing bugs.\nCDP frees the programmer from having to reason globally and computing or describing \"emerging behaviors.\"\nHave a look at the truss bridge demo shown below, an original Sketchpad and ThingLab demo and remade here using Sketchpad14. As you can see the resulting \"emergent behavior\" of the program is quite elaborate! There is not an easy way to \"code\" the behavior of this bridge under the forces of gravity and wind imperatively. On the other hand, as you can see on the constraint listing on the right pane, the constraint types that make up this overall behavior are not complicated at all. We only had to define velocity and acceleration behaviors as well as the spring force (Hook's law). Thus the programmer only has to reason \"locally\" and in \"isolation\" about each constraint. Next, we simply had to instantiate these constraints for all the bodies and beams (springs) that make up the bridge. It is the job of the system to capture the \"global\" behavior by combining the results of individual local constraints.\nHave a look at the video demo below. Within the parables demo we have loaded another demo, called mid point, where a red dot always is maintained at the middle between two blue dots. You'll see that we merge their behavior into three of the shapes from the parables example. And viola! The shapes retain their previous behavior (swinging, etc.) yet also take on the new behavior of the mid point example.\nDoing this in IP is by no means easy. Where do we add this new behavior? How do we make sure the previous behaviors still work?\nCDP enforces a particular way of organizing a program and its execution model follows a specific routine. With each change, the tool evaluates each constraint to compute current errors, solves the ones unsatisfied, combines the solutions, applies the final solution, and repeats the process until convergence occurs. All this machinery can be a huge overhead over a hand-coded imperative code that performs the precise set of necessary instructions to accomplish a certain task. For seamless animations, the overhead of computation is exacerbated by the fact that we might repeat the above process at a rate of 60 times per second!\nNonetheless, fortunately easy optimization opportunities were leveraged in the tool. By simply keeping track of the total error of the system and detecting reaching convergence (whether with acceptable or non-acceptable error value), the system draws the scene a final time and then goes idle, until the next time there is a change caused by an event, including advancement of time in temporal examples.\nThere are also efficiency issues associated with solving problems using any iterative approach as in relaxation, hill climbing, etc.\nTo conform to the CDP model, behaviors previously accomplished by snippets of code that directly update program state must be refactored, a source of burden to most programmers. The code must be organized to produce a dictionary object of proposed patches, rather than directly manipulating the state. The system needs to also be given a merge function to combine solutions from individual constraints.\nIt hasn't quite come up in our short list of examples here, but the choice of how large or fine-grained constraints are organized is very important. Consider the example of solving a system of arithmetic linear equations.\nClearly, setting up a separate constraint for each equation and then relying on iterative relaxation to converge the solutions from each equation is not the way to go! In that case, we have a very efficient solving tool, e.g. simplex method to simultaneously solve all the equations at once. What's nice is that the CDP model gives us the power to just use that: we simply create one constraint type that represents the system of equations, whose solve function will invoke a simplex solver to compute the answer.\nor only loosely related, behaviors.\n\"Parallelism\" is about performing independent computations in parallel for efficiency, while \"concurrency\" concerns ensuring these parallel computations don't get in the way of each other.\nAs we have seen earlier, when dealing with finite-domain or integer constraints the Sketchpad/Overveld approach of averaging solutions to consolidate does not make sense. In our experience so far, combining solutions in these cases is not difficult. Often, the programmer has the knowledge that for a fact only one constraint will be updating a particular variable. In the case of arrays or dictionaries, we simply could combine the solutions after verifying multiple updates pertain to distinguished indices/keys and therefore compatible.\nIn brief, more experience is needed to evaluate if the model holds up well in general.\nWe're blanking out here, but we're sure there are more issues. Can you point out some?", "version": "v0"}

Sleepy fishing villages line the picture-perfect coast with faded pastel shacks selling snacks and bric-a-brac while kids play dominoes on the beach.\nWhile the girls played games, a grandmother napped nearby, keeping one eye open on our small tourist group. We had arrived by catamaran, a leisurely trip through impossibly turquoise waters.\nA group of young boys and girls eagerly posed for pictures in the sand and then began braiding my hair. It doesn\u2019t get anymore relaxing than this and it also doesn\u2019t get anymore culturally authentic.\nI\u2019m not the type that likes cloistered tourist islands (which is why I couldn\u2019t fall in love with the lovely Hamilton Island). What is the point of traveling if you don\u2019t experience the local culture?\nThat being said, Saona Island does receive a lot of tourists and filmmakers, but I really don\u2019t think the boy chasing his donkey down the beach was a set-up.\nAnother hungry burro lapped up pineapples with insatiability, the sweet sticky juice pouring down his face, as a woman fed him by hand.\nBefore we arrived on Saona, we snorkeled in the clear blue ocean in search of puffy indigenous starfish. The unspoiled beauty gives evidence that Saona is a protected nature preserve.\nOn the way home, we stopped at a beach bungalow for a heaping plate of Dominican paella, grilled fish, and veggies, then laid out under breezy palms until we could muster the energy to board the boat again. Adult beverages overflowed on the catamaran which inevitably led to dancing as the unrelenting sun finally dipped below the horizon.\nSaona Island is easily accessible from Punta Cana via a paid boat tour. Our tour included a trip to Hoya Azul as well (more on that soon).\nHave you been to Dominican Republic? What was your favorite experience there?\nPineapples on the beach. Feeding a donkey a pineapple. Quick where do I sign up to get here! I\u2019ve not been to the Dominican Republic but it\u2019s certainly on the list now.\nI love animals so it was pretty fun petting the wild burros.\nI\u2019ve been to the Dominican Republic (Punta Cana) and I also took a catamaran but we didn\u2019t go to Saona Island. The Caribbean beaches are hard to beat and looking at your photos makes me want to escape Winter asap!\nThe kids were immediately ready for their close-ups. Loved meeting them.\nYes, very laid back and relaxing island to visit.\nI have a lot of friends from Dominican Republic here in Spain telling me so much about the country and of course Saona Island, but not having to see photos yet so, I just really wanna thank you for providing this great post filled with beautiful photos and lovely people. I\u2019m in!!!\nI\u2019ve been to the Dominican Republic and it was not nearly as beautiful as the place you visited. I must\u2019ve gone to the wrong place! Your photos are stunning and now I am reconsidering a trip back to discover the more beautiful side!\n300 people! I love the sound of Saona Island, it must be such a charming little place \ud83d\ude42 Like you, I\u2019m not a massive fan of overly touristy spots, so this would be perfect. And your photos are gorgeous as always, I really need to add the Dominican Republic to my list of places I need to visit now!\nI really want to visit the Dominican Republic. I like that you want to get to know the local culture instead of just sitting at a resort. The water looks so gorgeous! Nice photos.\nMore culture posts to come!\nGorgeous place and you captured such beautiful photos. I have never been, but I agree that I would rather go somewhere with less tourists! I\u2019d love to visit here someday.\nMaybe I\u2019m a little bias being Dominican myself but man I love my little island! Glad you had a blast.\nThe Dominican Republic is pure paradise! I\u2019ve only been to punta Cana but would love to visit a more intimate location like this!\nHi Shane. Thanks for reading!\nWhat excursion company did you go through!?

It may be tempting to try to handle the procedure yourself rather than retain an attorney. However, the decisions made during a divorce often have serious long-term consequences. Sometimes when couples want to handle a divorce themselves, without the involvement of lawyers, they are simply not able to communicate with each other sufficiently to reach an agreement. At other times the issues are too complex to be worked out without the help of a lawyer. Tenacious and compassionate Bergen County divorce attorney Brian D. Iton can guide individuals throughout Bergen County and the surrounding areas toward a satisfactory divorce settlement.\nThe overwhelming majority of divorce cases are finalized through a written settlement agreement signed by both spouses. The question is: What is the best route for you to get to an agreement with your spouse on the issues in your case? To arrive at a divorce settlement agreement you have three basic options: (1) you can work out your issues outside of court, with or without a lawyer, and process your case on an uncontested basis; (2) you can attempt mediation with a private mediator, or; (3) you can file for a contested divorce.\nUncontested divorces are those in which the spouses agree on the issues in their case outside of court, write up their agreement (if necessary) and ask the court to grant them a divorce based on their written agreement.\nOnce you and your spouse reach agreement on the issues the divorce settlement agreement can be drafted. The divorce settlement is a written contract in which the spouses agree on all major issues, such as how to split the marital property, whether spousal support will be paid, and how much time a child will spend with each parent. It should be noted that issues relating to child custody and parenting time (visitation) may be modified by the court even after the agreement is signed and the divorce is finalized (usually until the child becomes an adult). During that period either parent can petition the court if there is a \u201csubstantial change in circumstances\u201d making it in the child's best interest to modify the earlier divorce settlement agreement. Similarly, certain financial and economic provisions set forth in the divorce settlement can be modified in appropriate circumstances if the court is presented with evidence of a substantial change in financial circumstances.\nIn a case where the spouses can communicate with one another the quickest and least expensive way to settle a case (and have a written settlement agreement prepared and signed) is for one spouse to work with a lawyer to produce a written settlement agreement containing all of the agreed upon issues. This written settlement agreement is then reviewed and signed by the other spouse (with or without a lawyer). Once this document is signed by both spouses it can be processed as an uncontested divorce.\nUsually coming to agreement requires some discussion of legal rights and options. This is where the lawyer can be very helpful in an uncontested divorce. For example, the lawyer can answer questions regarding the grounds for the divorce, property division, child support, child custody, and spousal support. Once the agreement is written up and signed only one person has to show up in court to process the divorce. The other party can default out and still have their rights protected through the signed settlement agreement.\nMediation is more expensive and more time-consuming than an uncontested divorce. However, if it works, it is usually less expensive and less time-consuming than a fully contested divorce. Depending on your situation mediation can work, or it can be a frustrating waste of time and money.\nIn a contested divorce case which is not settled prior to trial a judge winds up making all the decisions related to the divorce. Important matters such as property division, child custody, and spousal support are settled by the judge, not the parties, if they can\u2019t reach agreement prior to the trial date. Almost all couples would prefer to settle these matters themselves.\nIf your situation requires that you file for a contested divorce there is still a very good chance that your case will be settled and not tried in front of a judge. In New Jersey contested divorces almost always become uncontested divorces through negotiation and signing of a marital settlement agreement.\nIf you are able to reach a divorce settlement and the divorce becomes uncontested, you can submit it to the court for approval. A court typically approves a contested divorce settlement as long as the court hears testimony from the parties that they believe the agreement is fair and that it was entered into without coercion. Therefore, when negotiating the agreement, it is important for spouses to keep in mind that the court will want to hear that both parties thought that the agreement was arrived at through a fair and voluntary process of negotiation. New Jersey family courts strongly favor divorce settlements, which is a good thing for families because going through a trial and paying expert witnesses, such as custody experts, employability experts, real estate and business appraisers, not to mention your lawyers can be extremely expensive.\nIn contested divorce cases, many settlements are reached at \u201c4-way\u201d conferences, where the parties and their lawyers sit down together and try to settle all of their issues. Divorce settlements are also achieved through court-sponsored early settlement conferences, intensive settlement conferences, and mandatory economic mediation. Like in an uncontested case, once the parties sign the settlement agreement it is made part of the divorce judgment.\nReaching a divorce settlement is more straightforward with the help of an experienced family law lawyer.

Mastercard has failed to halt the European registration the logo Lark, on grounds that it is too similar to its own. According to the European Trademark Office EUIPO, there\u2019s is no risk of the two logos being confused.\nLike many major brands, Mastercard has registered its trademark for a large number of products and services, even though it will never use them for many of these, such as caravans. Yes, it\u2019s true: the famous yellow and red Mastercard logo has also been registered in Europe for caravans! Well, you never know, do you?\nRecently, Mastercard\u2019s trademark registration for caravans looked to be about to prove its value, when a Polish company applied for trademark protection for the device mark Lark for caravans and mobile homes that strongly resembled Mastercard\u2019s own. No worries, Mastercard clearly thought. But things turned out differently.\nEUIPO concluded that the two logos were in fact quite dissimilar. Granted, both depicted yellow and red circles, but otherwise they differed in many ways, EUIPO said. The Lark logo consists of 3 circles containing stripes and a horizontal white bar. Crucially, the word Lark also features prominently. All in all, then, there were enough differences to ensure that there was no risk consumers would confuse the two logos, the trademark office concluded.\nA surprising outcome, to say the least. The first surprise is the view that there\u2019s no risk of confusion. Although Mastercard doesn\u2019t use its logo for caravans, it owns full trademark rights to do so. So if you were to see a caravan bearing a Mastercard logo, you\u2019d surely be confused if you then saw one with a Lark logo?\nThe second surprise is that a multinational like Mastercard didn\u2019t claim the worldwide reputation of its logo as part of its opposition (did they forget?). If it had, it would have had a much greater chance of success.", "version": "v0"}

All the contentious issues regarding Aurangzeb, such as his policy on temple destruction, his treatment of non-muslims, of rebels such as Shivaji and Tegh Bahadur, and of his own kin, the economy of India, the living conditions of the lowest strata of society, etc. will eventually be addressed in thorough detail here insha-Allah.\nUnder the 50-year reign of Hadhrat Aurangzeb (rahmatullahi alayh), India reached its zenith and became the most powerful and richest country in the world. The unprecedented wealth and prosperity (conservative estimates by even anti-mughal \u201cexperts\u201d attribute to Aurangzeb\u2019s India more than 25% of world GDP) which India experienced under the rule of Aurangzeb, were enjoyed by all strata of the society, from the commoners to the nobility, both Muslims and non-Muslims, as shall be demonstrated in this blog \u2013 a level of prosperity which India, terribly impoverished even today in this so-called age of enlightenment, peace and harmony, has yet to come close to achieving ever since Aurangzeb\u2019s reign, 300 years ago.\nThere is agreement amongst friend and foe alike that Aurangzeb was the epitome of orthodox Islam and a firm adherent to Islamic teachings in every sphere of life.\nAccording to the enemies of Islam, including many so-called \u201cobjective\u201d academics and historians, Islam was spread throughout the world, including India, through tyranny and oppression. Such alleged tyranny and oppression, in the fabricated revisionist history, involve genocide and forced conversions of countless non-muslims (Kuffaar) of all faiths, and the systematic destruction of their places of worship.\nFurthermore, since it is alleged that the root of all the tyranny and oppression inflicted by Muslim rulers is Islam itself \u2013 in its most pure form i.e. orthodox and conservative Islam, and since all agree that Aurangzeb was an orthodox and conservative practitioner of Islam, Aurangzeb\u2019s life and rule provides an ideal test case to measure the accuracy of this alleged connection between Islam and tyrannical oppression.\nThe New York Times, for example, attributes to Aurangzeb the Holocaust of 4.6 million civilians. We shall examine all the sources, from the mammoth volume of vernacular accounts of contemporary Hindus that have reached us, on detailed and graphic descriptions (or the absolutely deafening silence thereof) of such Holocausts allegedly perpetrated by Aurangzeb, who is regarded widely as the most fanatical, puritanical and ardent practitioner of Islam amongst the rulers of India, and in the process of which we shall also be able to present an accurate portrayal of his supposedly tyrannical regime, allegedly ruled with an iron-fist, in which non-muslims are supposed to have been systematically subjected to mass-slaughter or mass-conversions, and their places of worship destroyed at every possible opportunity.\nThe abundant sources and contemporary accounts which shed light on Aurangzeb and his reign, will enable the sincere seeker of truth to determine whether this alleged connection between Islam and tyranny is tenable or not, or whether it is part of a satanic propaganda fabricated by the enemies of truth and Islam.\nThe quotes, citations, eye-witness accounts, and other evidences will initially be gathered below in the form of brief posts. Later, when time permits, the material will be arranged and ordered in a coherent manner as part of a comprehensive article insha-Allah.\nBefore proceeding, due to the massive ignorance that prevails currently regarding Islam, it needs to be clarified that Islam in its original form \u2013 i.e. orthodox, conservative Islam \u2013 is based on the ancient 1400 year-old Shariah (Islamic Law) which is represented today ONLY by the Four Madh-habs \u2013 schools of the thought which comprise of all the original rulings of Islam, and which have been accepted by the Islamic empire for over a thousand years. Orthodox Islam has absolutely nothing to do with modernist and salafi versions of the religion which \u2013 by the admission of such groups \u2013 seek to override or \u201cimprove\u201d or \u201cmodernise\u201d the Ancient Law represented by the Four Madh-habs, and which today have produced perverted mutations such as ISIS, al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, Pakistani Fake Taliban, etc. and other groups influenced by Salafist and modernist reformist ideologies that demand the abandonment of Rigid Taqleed (tightly binding oneself) to the set of unchangeable and immutable rulings and values which constitute the Four Madh-habs.\nAurangzeb himself and the scholars around him were all orthodox Muslims \u2013 staunch followers of the Hanafi school and generally affiliated to one of the authentic Sufi paths.\nWe shall begin with Saubhagya Vijaya, a priest of the Jains \u2013 who were regarded as Kaafir Hindus by Aurangzeb and other Muslim rulers.\nWorth noting from the quote above, as will become even more evident from numerous other eye-witness accounts of contemporaries, is the fact that Aurangzeb held an open-door policy in his court, as was the Sunnah (way) of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Sunnah of all the pious Muslim rulers in history. In an Empire which Aurangzeb stretched to its greatest limits despite severe limitations \u2013 an empire which even exceeded in population the Ottoman Empire \u2013 every person, whether Muslim or Kaafir (non-muslim), poor or rich, was able to petition Hadhrat Aurangzeb directly in his court.\nAurangzeb\u2019s much-maligned treatment of his sons, brother, father, and other family members lends further support to his justice, impartiality, incorruptibility, and fair application of the Rule of Law on all his subjects \u2013 rich or poor, noble or commoner, kin or foreigner. While Aurangzeb\u2019s temperament was characterized by mercy and kindheartedness \u2013 as will be shown to be attested to by some of his harshest critics \u2013 he did not hesitate to apply the Law whenever it was warranted.\nThe lowlier the offender the more merciful was Aurangzeb.\nYet he was a man of great humility, soft-spoken, mild-mannered and of equable temper. He was particularly kindly in his treatment of the lowly.\nWe shall examine both Aurangzeb\u2019s principled treatment of his family, and his mercy and kindheartedness towards the poor and weak, in much more detail later.\n\u201cIn his sacred Court no improper conversation, no word of backbiting or falsehood, is allowed. His courtiers, on whom his light is reflected, are cautioned that if they have to say anything which might injure the character of an absent man, they should express themselves in decorous language and at full detail.\nHe appears two or three times every day in his court of audience with a pleasing counte\u00adnance and mild look, to dispense justice to complainants who come in numbers without any hindrance, and as he listens to them with great attention, they make their representations with\u00adout any fear or hesitation, and obtain redress from his impartiality.\nIf any person talks too much, or acts in an improper manner, he is never displeased, and he never knits his brows. His courtiers have often desired to prohibit people from showing so much boldness, but he remarks that by hearing their very words, and seeing their gestures, he acquires a habit of forbearance and tolerance.\nAlthough Alexander Hamilton resided and travelled throughout India and many other countries in the East over a period of many decades, interacting with countless Hindus, and although he documented so much of what he experienced in the minutest detail, there is no mention of any outrage felt by the Hindus under this supposedly brutal, repressive regime in which Hindus were allegedly subject to severe oppression, mass-genocide and forced conversions \u2013 as alleged by many revisionist historians.\nWe shall later compare and contrast such \u201coppressive\u201d rates of customs and taxes with those found in India today and also with those found in countries regarded as the leaders of modern \u201ccivilisation\u201d today.\nFurthermore, it was the case in many cities throughout India that unprecedented wealth and prosperity were enjoyed by both Muslims and Hindus, as explicitly witnessed and testified by Hamilton in that particular city.\nMuch more will also be posted regarding the dreaded Jizyah tax.\nAlthough the accounts of European travellers do contain myths, fables, gossip and tales from the bazaar, they have some value when they narrate personal experiences and direct eye-witness accounts.\n\u201cI think it hard to judge whether the Moores [i.e. Muslims] or Rashbootes [i.e. Hindus] are more ridiculous in their ceremonies; the Moores favour more of the papistes & this ceremony is like their exposing the Relics of some saint.\nWilliam Norris made this observation right near the end of Aurangzeb\u2019s reign when Aurangzeb\u2019s alleged tyranny and bigotry was supposed to have reached their worst levels.\nSuch is the high esteem in which the Jain Hindus held this supposedly tyrannical Emperor, that Jnan Chandra found books of the Jains to contain colophons praising Aurangzeb, near the end of his reign, at a time when his alleged reputation for temple-destroying and kuffaar-massacring would have become firmly entrenched throughout Indian society. Jnan Chandra quotes a few such instances of praise found in the colophons of the books written by Jain priests, poets and authors.\nMuch more to come when time permits\u2026\u2026.\nNext PostNext Halaal Slaughter \u2013 Humane or Inhumane?", "version": "v0"}

During that three-month period there were at least 349 civilian deaths, with a national total of 685 civilians killed.\nBetween January and May this year there were an average of 44 civilian casualties every month in Hodeidah. The subsequent three months (June-August) saw the figure jump to a monthly average of 116 \u2013 an increase of 164 per cent. This is in line with a renewed offensive in June by the Saudi- & Emirati-led Coalition to retake Hodeidah and its port.\nSave the Children field teams are meeting children who have suffered severe and life-changing injuries caused by explosive weapons, from airstrikes to landmines. Treating these injuries is particularly challenging in Yemen, where the health system has all but collapsed, prosthetics are hard to come by and there are few surgeons trained to treat traumatic injuries.\nHodeidah and its vital port are currently controlled by the Houthis but the Saudi- and Emirati-led Coalition has been trying to wrestle back control over this strategic city over the past few months. This has led to a marked increase in attacks on civilians.\nThere has been more than a three-fold (342 per cent) increase in verified civilian casualties in Hodeidah over the past two years, with 129 recorded in 2016 to 571 in just the first eight months of this year (January-August). The actual civilian death toll is likely to be higher as many deaths go unreported and based on current trends many more civilians are likely to die before the end of the year. In July and August alone at least 100 children were killed across Yemen.\nHelle Thorning-Schmidt, CEO of Save the Children International has recently returned from a trip to Yemen, visiting children and families affected by the war there.\n\u201cIn the past few months we've seen a shocking spike in violence - from an airstrike that hit a school bus full of children to a bombing near a hospital. Battles are being fought in densely populated urban areas and children end up trapped on the frontline, risking death or life-changing injuries. Attacks on schools and hospitals are up \u2013 safe spaces that should never be targeted. This is a War on Children. The world seems to be accepting an outrageous disregard for the conventions of war, and children are paying the price. It\u2019s shocking that in the 21st Century we are retreating on a principle that is so simple \u2013 children should be protected.", "version": "v0"}

There are 'fawn' Boxers, so the blonde and warm ginger colours I chose reflect that. But some have brindle coats, and they ALL have black noses -- so I needed black, as well.\nI played with many designs, on paper with coloured pencils, until I found a composition I liked. This is it -- though at half-scale, since the sett I registered is suitable for long yardage such as they use in making kilts.\nThis was officially registered as a new tartan by the Scottish Register of Tartans in October 2013.\nThe scarf, at top, is woven of worsted wool. The cushion cover below is woven with cotton. The different materials give a slightly different effect. The weaver is Molly Manaugh of Alaska. She does a beautiful job!\nThis design was pretty, but I rejected it.\nMy other tartan design is also about love, but this time, love of freedom. It represents the free countries of my three citizenships: the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. I wanted a sort of delft blue instead of a very dark blue to represent the UK and American flags (Canada is of course represented by the red and white, but literally and figuratively there is 'overlap' of colours!). I wanted a less somber and more vibrant, even electric, effect. Registered October 2013.\nThis shows very well an interpretation of the design, in consultation with the weaver, who chose yarns that she thought best approached the colours I had specified.\nThe weaver sent these suggested colours for each of the patterns, and I chose the ones I thought best. One or two of the selections were obvious; the others I really had to compare and think about.\nI think the key colour in both of these is the white. It lets the designs 'breathe', making the eternal interlock of stripes and squares a playful thing, not a bore. The white seems to glow, too, in natural light.\nMy tartan patterns (or 'setts') woven into cushion covers ('pillows', Americans call them) and displayed on the weaver's website.

No company wants this to happen as it lands them into serious legal troubles. The accidents happen due to numerous mechanical, electrical, radiations and thermal processes. This not only affects the normal proceedings of the company but also lowers their profits and hampers their reputation in the market. Therefore, plant risk assessment is very importance to avoid the deaths of company workers and legal troubles. It is imperative for every employer to provide safe working environment to employees along with salaries and other benefits.\nHow would you install the plant risk management system in your business?\nThe first step involves a visit of assessor for inspecting the office premises and work atmosphere. This inspection also includes listing the machinery and other equipment. This should be done with proper care. The technical team will evaluate your machineries and make a detail report. Afterward, you can make the changes as per their suggestions.\nThe next step after this is to analyze various parts and equipment being used in plant. Observe how they are used and for which purpose. Analyzing their condition is the most important thing to do. It will help you to know if they are in working condition or allied with any risk.\nThird step of plant risk assessment is to evaluate safety rules and the company must maintain all safety rules implemented by the local municipal authority and government agencies. The assessor also must make sure if the safety guidelines are conveyed to entire workforce and they should maintain the safety regulations.\nThe next step involves a thorough study of incidents occurred in past which caused serious injuries or even deaths to find out the reason behind them. After finding out the reasons, the company can easily prevent such issues in future and increase their productivity without any risk.\nNext step is to prepare detailed report mentioning reasons for dangers and necessary steps to avoid them. The controlling measures should also be documented in detail. After getting this detail report, the plant owners can make necessary changes in their manufacturing units.\nInjured employees cannot work properly, and this can hamper the production. Whereas a proper risk assessment leads to provide safe and healthy work environment to workers. Therefore, they can work with higher efficiency using all their potential. This helps in maintaining good quality of production.\nAs there is no risk surrounding them while working, employees will work without any tension and with positive attitude. Positive attitude will certainly affect production in a positive way and company will gain profits. The company will have pleasant environment with minimum risks of calamities.\nReduction of accidents is the main objective of any company and plant risk assessment helps them to obtain this objective. The machines and equipment are properly maintained reducing the possibility of accidents. This will make the workforce tension free. Apart from that, the company can also identify the potential problems of their machines and they can easily repair the same to prevent any issue in future.\nWhen any accident happens, the company must fight legal battles with families of injured or dead worker. The company needs to clarify the reasons to the safety department and if the safety department does not agree with the company then they will penalize the company with huge amounts. This will surely hamper not only the efficiency but also the reputation of the company.\nPlant risk assessment is important for any company for ensuring the safety of the workers. This management system not only safe the company from legal problems, but the company can also increase their productivity by giving secure atmosphere to their employees.", "version": "v0"}

At the crudest level we can simply sort them out by color with the reddest stars being the coolest and the blue ones the hottest.\nWien's Law lets us quantify the color-temperature relationship but Wien's Law give temperature for objects with Planck-like spectra. Stars don't quite have Planck spectra because of the absorption lines and flux redistribution and other complications like that.\nMost stars APPEAR redder than they really are. This means if we use colors to estimate temperatures we always measure stars cooler than their real temperatures.\nStars of a given Luminosity appear fainter than you would calculate given the distance and inverse sqaure law.\nThese things lead to all sorts of confusion.\nA long time ago, astronomers recognized that different stars had dramatically different absorption lines in their spectra. Some had strong absorption lines due to Hydrogen and little else, some had no Hydrogen lines and many lines due to Iron, Calcium and other elements. The different spectral types where assigned letters with type A having the strongest Hydrogen absorption lines, type B the next strongest and on down the alphabet (skipping lots of letters for various reasons).\nOne COULD conclude that these stars had different chemical compositions, but the strong correlations between the presence of various lines and a star's color suggested the underlying cause was Atomic physics.\nHere is how it works: Think about the absorption lines caused when a gas of Hydrogen atoms absorbs photons with energy that corresponds to an electron jumping from the 1st excited state to the 2nd excited state in the H atom. This photon has a wavelength of 636.5nm (remember? ).\nFor this to happen, there must be some H atoms in the gas with their electron in the 1st excited state.\nessentially all the H atoms have their electrons in the ground state so even if there are many H atoms, there will be no tell-tale absorptions at 636.5nm.\nYou could also imagine a star with a very HIGH surface temperature. Now, there are many energetic collisions and a large fraction of the hydrogen atoms are ionized with no chance of producing absorption lines.\nOr, for a star of just the right temperature such that collisions continuously populate the 1st excited state with electrons, there will be LOTS of photons caught that bump the electrons to the 2nd excited level and there will be strong H-absorption lines.\nThe lack of Hydrogen absorption lines in a star does not necessarily mean the star's atmosphere is devoid of Hydrogen, could also mean that the star has a low or very high surface temperature.\nThese temperature effects are far and away the most important things when determining spectra types. This can be turned around and we can use Spectral Types to assign surface temperatures for stars.\nOne very nice thing about the spectral type of a star is that it doesn't change as you add more and more dust between the Earth and a star.\nQ. Suppose you measure two stars with identical Spectral Type but Star X is much redder than Star Z. What do you conclude? The colors of Star X have been strongly effected by interstellar reddening.\nThis has lead to lots of dumb pneumonic devices to remember the sequence.\nNow we can see how to extend the distance ladder to beyond the parsecs that we get from Trigonometric parallax. This is a technique called Spectroscopic Parallax.\nNow compare the Apparent brightness and Luminosity, apply the inverse square law and you have the distance.\nHold it! What about dust? If the distant star has a redder color than its nearby spectral-type match, the color difference tells you how much dust there is along the line-of-sight and we can calculate how much of the dimming is due to dust and how much is due to distance.", "version": "v0"}

The magazine admits not to \u201chave a precise formula for constructing the list \u2013 it reflects the collective wisdom of our editors and writers.\u201d Only CEOs with at least five years in their position are eligible to enter the list. In the 10 years since Barron\u2019s launched the list, corporate boards have increasingly come under fire. The credit crisis, volatile energy prices, and disruptive technologies turned the decade into something of a CEO killer. Of the 30 CEOs listed in the first edition ten years ago, seven have kept their jobs and only two remain in the list: Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Michael O\u2019Leary of Ryanair Holdings. The 30 CEOs listed come from all parts of the globe. Twenty of the companies they run are U.S.-based; five are based in Europe, and five are Asian.\nSeven CEOs have been added to the list this year: Robert Iger of Walt Disney, Joseph Jimenez at Novartis, Macy\u2019s Terry Lundgren, Sergio Marchionne at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Larry Merlo at CVS Health, Under Armour \u2019s Kevin Plank, and Aditya Puri, managing director of India-based HDFC Bank. Eight CEOs have been removed, making way for new faces. They are Amazon.com \u2019s Jeffrey Bezos, Mark Donegan at Precision Castparts, Hugh Grant at Monsanto, Nick Hayek of Swatch Group, CBS\u2019 head Leslie Moonves, Ford Motor \u2019s Alan Mulally, Norbert Reithofer of BMW, and Lars Rebien S\u00f8rensen at Novo Nordisk.\nWhile on the one hand this ranking provides an interesting perspective on the performance of CEOs, its methodology is merely based on the personal views of Barron\u2019s editorial team and writers \u2013 and therefore highly subjective and non-transparent. The fact that the vast majority of the CEOs in this \u201cglobal\u201d ranking are US-Americans shows that their might also be an ethnocentric halo effect included.\nSummarizing, Barron\u2019s\u2019 \u201cWorld\u2019s Best CEOs\u201d is a useful ranking to get a snapshot of successful CEOs (and their well-performing firms). But caution is necessary: The CEOs listed are nothing more than a subjective recommendation \u2013 and they do not provide any reference how exactly they got there. Due to the long history and consistency of the ranking, comparisons and developments over time are possible \u2013 which is a significant advantage for interested readers.\nUnfortunately, the full list and the corresponding article are only available for subscribers.\nComment: Ranking is published for the 11th time in a row.\nComment: According to Barron\u2018s, there is no fixed methodology but the list \u201ereflects the collective wisdom of our editors and writers\u201c.\nComment: Methodology not explained at all.\nComments: Comment: Methodology is only mentioned in print and online article, which are only accessible for subscribers.", "version": "v0"}

The Swiss researchers say that their findings indicate that regulatory assessments of nanosilver have been overly stringent and should be brought in line with traditional silver coatings.\nAs nanosilver \u2013 the most widely used engineered nanoparticle \u2013 is incorporated into increasing numbers of products for its antimicrobial properties, the potential risks have become a hot topic, particularly with regard to silver nanoparticles entering the environment. Although the danger to human health is considered to be relatively low, studies have shown that silver nanoparticles can be toxic to many aquatic organisms and bioaccumulate in the food chain.\nBut it seems nanosilver textiles aren\u2019t necessarily the culprit behind the rise in environmental silver nanoparticles. Bernd Nowack and colleagues at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology have shown that nanosilver fabrics actually leak far fewer nanoparticles when washed than previously thought. Moreover, they found that textiles impregnated with silver release equal or greater numbers of nanoparticles when washed.\nNowack\u2019s team prepared several textiles using non-nano silver treatments, including silver chloride and silver zeolite powder, and nanosilver. They also obtained a commercially available nylon fabric coated with non-nano silver called X-Static. After washing, they found that there were the same or more silver nanoparticles in the wastewater of fabrics treated with non-nano silver than nanosilver.\nAs Nowack showed that silver nanoparticles can form naturally, he suggests that nanosilver was always unknowingly included in risk assessments of traditional silver treatments. \u2018So there is likely no additional risk of nanosilver,\u2019 he says.\nThis article is reproduced with permission from Chemistry World.

In either case, if used meaningfully and purposefully, teachers can build a trusting community for learning through sarcasm and humorous banter in the classroom.\nNew research appearing in the Journal of Adolescent and Adult Literacy sheds light on the use of sarcasm in building and sustaining positive rapport with students, including English as a new language students. The findings could provide educators with new ideas on how sarcasm can be used meaningfully to develop critical language understanding and positive relationships between teachers and students in high-poverty urban settings such as Rochester.\nThe study was led by Joanne Larson, a professor and researcher from the University of Rochester\u2019s Warner School of Education, with English teacher Timothy Morris and English for speakers of other languages teacher Kristen Shaw from East Upper and Lower Schools in Rochester participating as research participants and co-authors.\nThe Rochester team sought to understand how the use of sarcasm in an urban high school English classroom fosters critical language awareness and positive relationships among a group of diverse students. Data were pulled from an ongoing study involving an ethnography of East, a school that\u2019s been transformed through an educational partnership organization developed by the Rochester City School District and UR.\nEast, once a persistently failing school, faced closure in 2014 by the state Education Department due to years of poor academic performance. The study involved observation field notes, formal and informal interviews, and documents and photographs collected during the first year and a half of the EPO partnership.\nThe research shows how the co-teachers used sarcasm to construct a sense of belonging that supports building positive relationships and creating a more comfortable environment for student learning. The team found the use of sarcasm can promote positive relationships and teachable language moments with students, especially ENLs with the assistance of an ESOL co-teacher. For example, the ESOL teacher could further explain the multiple meanings and uses of various words or phrases used by another teacher\u2019s sarcastic one-liner, such as \u201cI\u2019m so down in the hood, I\u2019m in the sleeve.\u201d This finding suggests these teachable moments are best supported by and successful with a push-in co-teaching approach, in which students see both teachers as equal partners and of equal value in the classroom.\nThe team also found that a purposeful and reflective use of sarcasm and humor can support students\u2019 understanding and learning of a complex language, in addition to broadening ENL students\u2019 vocabulary. The research suggests the use of sarcasm to construct a sense of belonging and build a positive relationship can, in turn, serve to lower the affective filters \u2014 an emotional response that can lock down the mental processes of learning a new language \u2014 among English language learners.\nThe research is part of a larger effort of the Center for Urban Education Success at the Warner School to research and work to identify, address and improve systems, practices and culture at East. The center will continue to leverage the knowledge gained at East to impact K-12 urban education regionally, nationally and globally.", "version": "v0"}

I don\u2019t usually make commissioned quilts, but of course, for a friend! The baby\u2019s dad is a huge fan of The Little Prince story so I set out to find themed fabric, and to my surprise, I found a Riley Blake collection.\nAfter mulling over pattern designs and how to best showcase all the fabrics, we decided on the easy, basic Checkered Baby Quilt. I like to use flannel backing on baby quilts, so we chose a cute star print that blended nicely with the others. And because I am one who certainly can\u2019t turn down striped binding, we settled on the blue, with yellow stars and green stripes.\nUpon the arrival of new fabric, I immediately got to work (more like \u2018play\u2019). As in making any quilt, I used some helpful techniques. After pin basting and before any quilting, I ran a long basting stitch across the top edge of the quilt, about an 1/8\u2033 down. This helps to eliminate any pull from quilting and it helps reduce shifting. Also, if the stitches are sewn less than 1/4\u2033 from the edge, you won\u2019t have to remove them before attaching the binding.\nInitially, I did the top only but I ended up adding a basting stitch along both sides because of slight puckering when sewing on the binding. It only took a few minutes and solved the problem.\nAnd lastly, if you have labels, be sure to sew one on the backing before quilting!\nHere are a few photos of the finished quilt. My friend was pleased with the results, and I hope the new mom and dad are too.\nI\u2019d also like to mention that if you\u2019re a beginner quilter or know someone who is, I highly recommend this pattern. Not only is it easy, it\u2019s fun! It\u2019s straight-forward, there are no bias edges, no half square triangles, and no cutting if you use precuts!", "version": "v0"}

And Soto has done it in just 421 plate appearances. To compare, Harper was worth 16.8 runs in 597 plate appearances.\nThen the dropoff in OPS at 19 is stunning, considering the greatness of most of the players in the top 10. Mickey Mantle (.792). Supernova Cesar Cedeno, who had a higher career WAR through age 25 than Willie Mays. Hall of Famer Freddie Lindstrom. Edgar Renteria, the only outlier, who nonetheless was World Series MVP at 21. Oh, and Ty Cobb (.749) and Ken Griffey, Jr. (.748). Entering his 100th game Wednesday, Soto\u2019s OPS was at .950.\nHas any teenager ever led his league in OB%?\nNo teenager who qualified for the batting title has ever had a 400 OBP before, so I'm guessing not.\nAlso, the submission shortened the headline of Boswell's article a bit, omitting the \"And It Doesn't Look Like A Fluke\" ending. More greatness of Juan Soto at BB-Ref's Age-19 MLB Leaderboard.\nbb-ref has an age-19 leaderboard and a through-age-19 leaderboard.\nAlways impressive when a current player cracks one of these lists.\nOtt's OBP at age 19 was .397 which was very impressive, but couldn't crack the top 10 in 1928 (and was 101 points behind Hornsby). Third place is Renteria's .358 so I don't think there are any league leaders.\nAs TFA states, there is a big dropoff less than 20. Lots of guys had big age 20 seasons, but relatively pedestrian seasons by Mantle & Cobb make the age-19 leaderboard.\nhe's still got a month to come to earth a little bit.\ni'm kinda rooting for that ... as a native new orleanian i have a soft spot for ol' mel ott.\nCap Anson won the OBP title when he was 20, when his team played 44 games. Jimmie Foxx, Mel Ott, and Ted Williams won it at 21. Levi Meyerle in 1871 and Pete Browning in 1882 also won it at 21 in shorter seasons.\nSay, can Soto moonlight as the Yankees' offseason batting coach?\nI'm guessing that \"Thomas Boswell\" is now the third or fourth guy writing under the same name?\nCome on, he's only 70.\nThe terrific teenager hit his 19th HR tonight, moving him past Mel Ott for 3rd place on the age-19 leaderboard linked in #3, as well as boosting his OPS to .954.\nThat looks like just what you'd expect for a guy who tailored his approach to take advantage of a short porch in his home field. Doubles and triples on the road went into the stands at home. He had 20 more extra base hits on the road for his career, which is just one for every full season he played.\nI always like sticking up for Ott. 188 HR is still a lot of road HR's in the NL in the 1930s. He'd have ~400 HR if he had played an eighth of his games at home instead of half.\nI took a fresh look at his splits. His BABIP numbers at the PG are significantly lower (.271/.315) which makes sense from the larger OF, but also because of the huge foul territory there. Also, the HR's had a much more reasonable split when he was younger. He was sitting at 57% after 1940 (age 31) and then had a 100/23 split (81%) for the rest of his career. That included a miserable 1943 season which he turned into an OPS+ of 134 thanks to 95 BB and an 18/0 HR split.\nBoswell, writing about the Weaver-era Orioles, was a large part of my introduction to both good writing and sabermetrics. Boswell mails in most of his stuff these days, but he had a Trout-like peak.\nBoz graduated from Amherst in 1969 and began working for the Post almost immediately. He was one of the best modern day game reporters I've ever read in the 70's and early 80's, with a deadline style that couldn't be beaten, but once he left the Orioles beat the quality of his writing declined noticeably. His best writing after than was on golf, not baseball.\nAcu\u00f1a could lead the NL in slugging as well. Currently at .575 and arenado is at .563.\nSean - as long as you're here ... do you add the oh-fers for other leaderboards? I note that Acuna's 151 OPS+ would be second in the league if he had enough PAs to qualify, but isn't listed.\nOtt's record has stood for 90 years, and Soto is in the process of besting it by a healthy margin. Sure, they're a couple of weeks left this season, and one should be cautious until a player repeats (or improves) his performance across several seasons, but what we're seeing now is extraordinary.\nHey, didn't the Nats have a pretty good teenager a couple of years ago? Whatever happened to him?\nFun fact: Soto has hit .300 for every team/season in his career.\n2018: .373 at Hagerstown (A), .371 at Potomac (A+), .323 at Harrisburg (AA) and .305 at Washington.\nHow many players have hit .300 for four different teams in the same year?\nLike a Dread Pirate Boswell?\nWe don't include it for OPS+. It would be overly complicated given how we calculate it. We do add the 0-fers for BA, SLG, OBP.\nSoto hit his 20th HR, and the RBI also broke a tie with Ken Griffey, Jr. for 6th on the Age-19 Leaderboard. His 2 runs scored tonight also passed Mel Ott & Tony C. in that category.", "version": "v0"}

It is shot on video on a presumably small budget, yet it has vistas and plot turns that would make David Lean\u2019s eyebrows furrow with envy.\nThe Two Towers was the best segment of Jackson\u2019s trilogy, and a real movie unto itself (in which the slippery Gollum emerged as the true protagonist of the whole saga). Polanski\u2019s Oscar-winner was a fine reminder of this director\u2019s command, and The Man Without a Past a beautiful example of what Kaurismaki can do when he rouses himself for disciplined work. Heaven, based on a Kieslowski script, is a strange little closed-system thing, but it\u2019s well suited to Tywker\u2019s particular talents and it gives a strong role to Cate Blanchett (even Giovanni Ribisi is on good behavior). And The Emperor\u2019s New Clothes, a comedy on the subject of Napoleon (Ian Holm in good form), sneaks in there because it\u2019s an ingenious picture that slipped by almost completely unnoticed.\nI almost made room for Robert Rodriguez\u2019s daffy Spy Kids 2, which is a real example of directorial giddiness; I feel less disappointed about leaving off the official arthouse successes of the year, Far from Heaven and Talk to Her.", "version": "v0"}

In addition, the Selectmen may appoint additional associated members of the Board who lack voting power but are routinely heard by the formal Board members. Board members as well as associated members must have engineering background and or technical project manager experience.\nFamiliarity with financial management is also desirable since the Board is also involved with the Enterprise Fund, an entity independent of the town fiscal structure. The Enterprise Fund collects all sewer and water related bills and fees.\nBased on Massachusetts Legislature Acts of 1921, Chapter 205, Section 9 and Acts of 1926, Chapter 136, Town Water and Sewerage Boards were created and made subject to State Regulations. These reference Statutes for Officers and Employees, Chapter 41.\nChapter 136 combines water and sewer authority into Board of Water and Sewerage (March 1926) These Boards came under Mass.

Chapter 41, Section 69B establishes \"Authority and Duties of Water Commissioners etc. Chapter 41, Section 69A was superseded by the Medfield Town Charter to appoint Water and Sewerage Commissioners.\nIn essence, the Board has full jurisdiction over any and all town water and sewer related plans, permits, setting rates and other items related thereto. The Town Meeting has the financial power to prevent or approve any plans offered by the Board. No other Board has any authority to interfere with the Water and Sewerage Board in performing their work.

Said regulations once promulgated, shall be filed with the Town Clerk and posted in a conspicuous place in or near its offices in the Town House to which the general public has access.\nAny person who engages in conduct prohibited by said regulations and not otherwise prohibited by Massachusetts General Laws or these Bylaws shall be subject to a fine of $100 for the first offense, $200 for the second offense, $300 for the third offense and $300 for each subsequent offense; in the case of \u201ccontinuing offense\u201d, each day shall constitute a separate offense. The Board of Water and Sewerage Commission, DPW Director or his designee and the Medfield Police Department shall each have authority to enforce the provisions of this Bylaw.\nEnterprise Funds were established by State Legislature under Chapter 44 Section 53F \u00bd. The Medfield Enterprise Fund was created by Town Vote in 1990 and should be self supporting. It may be used to operate and maintain the water and sewer infrastructure of the town. It also may be used to fund water and sewer related engineering and construction projects.\nThe Fund has to report on a yearly basis to the community and the State. Special expenditures from reserves are justified during town meetings and must be approved by the town. The Enterprise Fund collects all sewer and water related bills and fees.", "version": "v0"}

Finding suitable materials for adults with autism can be difficult. Most books are written for a younger age group, and those written for older individuals often contain too much text\u2014which can be visual overload.\nThis book is absolutely needed by my students on the spectrum.  So much of what's available is geared at younger students, and the older ones are just forgotten, but they need these basic instructions.  The book presents each topic in bite-sized pieces, and introduces them in the context of a conversation.  It's a real person who is walking through life and helping them to understand what needs to be done and why (such as washing clothes or going to the doctor).  The book has good graphics, easy-to-read text, and is easy to reference, should they need to go back and re-read something.  Students can get answers to the questions that they didn't even know they had!\nExcellent! A must read for young people on the spectrum.\nA little suggestion the examples are very American, needs adaptation for Europe.\nReview is scheduled for publication date.\nThis is a very informative book. I read for both personal and professional reasons. If you are a parent of an autistic child or even an adult who wishes to learn more, I\u2019m sure many of these things you have discovered already. That being said, if you have just received a diagnosis or are not familiar with autism this is a great book to read.\nThis book also includes a how-to guide on life basics such as health, cooking, laundry, and emergencies for those on the Autism Spectrum.\nAutism is a complex syndrome that varies from person to person. No two people have the exact same profile. But, as the author reminds us, every person shares the same dreams, wants, and need for understanding. Evan as adults they are often reduced to their deficits because each day is a struggle to find a way to fit in.\nHowever, family members and friends often forget that the person with autism still deserves and needs to be loved and respected for what they CAN do because ultimately what they can do is going to carry them through life.\nThank you netgalley and the publishers for giving me the chance to read this book in exchange for my honest review.\nThis book will become a necessary part of our educational program, not only for students on the spectrum, but other students with special needs, as well.. The layout with a personal and human introductory paragraph in each chapter is both simple and engaging, drawing the young adult reader in and giving them an opportunity to identify with others. If the title didn't include the word \"autism,\" I would be tempted to distribute this to every high school freshman because they all could use help in understanding \"what they need to know.\" We, as teachers, and other adults in their lives don't do enough to help young people learn about the basic life skills they need to survive in a complex world.", "version": "v0"}

Daisy responded by pleading, \u201cDon't share that. Are you interneting right now? Don't internet that!\u201d So, I stopped what I was doing and jotted down everything she had said.\nI was just thinking about this issue after reading Posting Pictures/Videos of Your Children Online on Random Thoughts of a Crazy Liberal. Alana responded to the many critical comments regarding a youtube video of a boy singing Bad Romance. The criticism was mainly of his parents for opening up a private though hilarious family moment to the public.\nI obviously share quite a bit about my kids online. I rationalize doing so partly because no one in my children\u2019s social circles reads my blog. I don\u2019t share it with parents of my children\u2019s friends. I don\u2019t share it with most people I know. I don\u2019t put any of our names on it, although there are pictures. But in case someone we know was to randomly come across it, no problem. I have standards as far as what I\u2019ll share. And occasionally, I\u2019ll edit or delete a post upon further consideration.\nI imagine that as my kids get older, I will have an evolving awareness of what I should share online. At some point, the kids probably deserve editorial privileges. Can you imagine how a teenager would feel if her mother blogged about how she got in trouble for not making it home by curfew, as well as documenting her flimsy yet charming excuse? Not that my kids will ever miss curfew. They won't be allowed to leave the house at night until they're too old to have a curfew. I'm not stupid.\nOn the other hand, kids can be lacking in judgment when it comes to the big, bad internet. That\u2019s what I think when I see this video. The kid seems really into it and I would assume he\u2019s fully aware and in support of it being posted. He might regret that one day, or maybe this is the beginning of a beautiful career. I certainly enjoyed it and am about to watch it again here in a minute. As one commenter remarked, kids love Lady Gaga, and my kids are in love with this video. I\u2019m a little concerned because now they want to do their own video. I\u2019ll let you know how that goes.\nThe choreography at 3:32 is worthy.\nI think I might have gotten a little defensive since I post pictures of Holden, but I still stand by what I said. Should parents use discretion? Yes. Is there a possibility a person may regret something he/she posts? Pretty much guaranteed (there are definitely posts I regret but I feel like I can\u2019t delete them for some reason). But to say it\u2019s exploitative is ridiculous IMO.", "version": "v0"}

This makes it more possible for others (maybe unknown today) to read (or watch) in a different place or at a different time.\nCodifying knowledge affords an immutability and mobility of the knowledge. Immutability fixes the knowledge in time, preserving it across time. Mobility means it can move beyond its creator and point of creation.\nAn upside of immutability is that you can feel certain about codified knowledge as fixed definitive content and this can give rise to a sense of community and continuity. A downside \u2013 it probably stopped being definitive before the proverbial ink dried.\nAn upside of mobility is that it can readily circulate. A downside \u2013 it needs supporting context to enable decisions about its relevance somewhere else; and if this is missing, its less usefulness is limited or non-existent.\nTrying to capture a substantive portion of what a person knows in a codified form is akin to writing a book on the person. And if it gets written, will anybody have the time or motivation to read it?\nHow about instead writing the Table of Contents on a person\u2019s knowledge?\nEnter the Knowledge Transfer Report. A succinct document that lists all the essential important topics and points to where to get details. Those details may be explicitly in a database, website or document; or more importantly, held implicitly (or tacitly) in an individual or group of individuals.\nThe design of the report addresses the issue of immutability by allowing for micro details (Chapter & Verse) to change while providing macro details (Table of Contents) which are more likely fixed. The form of the report gives a vehicle for circulating the knowledge.\nThe Table of Contents (ToC) concept embodies an organisation structure with sequence and/or logical groupings with which to traverse a body of knowledge. It\u2019s the map of the territory \u2013 rather than detailed step-by-step instructions. It\u2019s scannable and doesn\u2019t need to be \u2018read\u2019 for the user to get immediate value. Re-using the form of ToC for the report content, empowers the user of the Report the freedom to explore and discover within useful parameters.\nLearn about the technique: the process and template.\nShare with us about your experimentation with the Knowledge Transfer Report, and other practical ideas to enable retention of critical knowledge.\nThis entry was tagged continuity, knower, knowledge retention, knowledge sharing, knowledge work, knowledge-base, manage, people, technique. Bookmark the permalink.\nRelevant topic for the work I am doing. We are conducting ROCK doing interviews and videos \u2013 using the TOC concept \u2014 but putting more emphasis on SOCK (sharing of critical knowledge) earlier on in one\u2019s career. If we build a culture of ongoing sharing, then the retention of knowledge will be in place when people depart. Work in progress!\nThanks Lisa for sharing what you are doing at Mercer. Great to hear about an emphasis on SOCK \u2013 that truly is a wiser and strategic move to not losing the knowledge. I hope the Knowledge Transfer Report can be useful response for situations where less forethought has prevailed.", "version": "v0"}

Fredericton, New Brunswick has a city lighthouse at a bend in the Saint John River, where the downtown is centered. The city is close enough to the Atlantic for the river\u2019s reversing currents to be witnessed. Tides from the Bay of Fundy send salt water upriver. A view, without fog, from a lighthouse is an inviting opportunity.\nThe lighthouses I know at home in Maine are anchored to rock ledges which are battered day and night by waves. Fredericton\u2019s modest lighthouse shines a beacon toward watercraft, but also overlooks some city streets and distant landscape.\nAfter making a circuit around the top of the tower with my camera, the sheer serenity of the place kept me there. There was certainly a better breeze than on the ground-level. Spiced with cool gusts, the sunlight was brilliant and unimpaired. And having no pressing time limitation, I found the niche between the beacon and the peripheral catwalk to be an ideal writing spot. Being instinctively drawn to edges and confluences, I wound up aperch the northwesterly direction, with the city to my left and the meandering widening river to my right and straight ahead. My week of sojourning along the Saint John came with the hope of unwinding and finding some uninterrupted writing time. Somehow, it took being at the top of the lighthouse- after several days of journeying, absorbing scenery, and flailing through mundane journal entries- for my words to begin finding the stride of the moment. So I stayed a good while, that much closer to the skies. Long enough to watch currents and clouds. Long enough to respire between paragraphs. As the beacon in its context, the writing and forward movement must persevere through all conditions in order to reach any sort of summit of thought.\nLooking toward the city buildings, I was reminded of one of my favorite features of Fredericton, which is the Poets\u2019 Corner. On the previous day, I\u2019d seen a rambunctious outdoor theatrical performance about the city\u2019s literary history. Recalling the syllabic formula for haiku, I came up with a simple one from and about the lighthouse. From there, my attention was drawn to the river path below. The descent to continue exploring was equally eager as my ascent had been to observe. Primarily, I sought photographic vantage points, but thankfully my stop atop the lighthouse turned out to be a way to find some words.\nSaint John has a Martello tower which I hope you got to see.", "version": "v0"}

No more betting in league play, said Winship, revealing he was under investigation by Tarpon Springs police.\nOk I get it. Running an illegal casino is illegal and there are technically laws against gambling but are these guys serious?

Call him a whistle blower or a good Samaritan, but lets not confuse reality this guy got fired, hates the guys who dominate the leagues and probably didn\u2019t tip him enough so he decided to be a little B. Well done. Hope you are happy with yourself. Hardo move right there.\nGood thing we never bet on golf.\nWell that was one hellava tournament. Again it\u2019s great to see tough courses, tough conditions and high scores. These guys are supposed to be the best of the best (WGC should mean something), so I was happy to see guys aiming for par instead of being upset over their mediocre 65s. Anyways here are the winners and losers from this week at Doral.\nPatrick Reed \u2013 This kid can play. Sure he looks like an overweight, unathletic 30-something out there but the fact is that he is 23 and just dominating these days. Make no mistake about it this was a legit win. This kind of victory is how guys win majors, specifically a US Open, where everyone is trying to tread water and he just kept on going. Not to mention he causally went wire to wire and was never in real jeopardy down the stretch. Kid kept his nerves in check for his biggest win of his very young career. If he keeps this up he will play himself into major contention and maybe even onto the Ryder Cup team (guy dominates match play).\nDoral and The Donald \u2013 Completely redone course in under 12 months. Only 3 guys under par and only 2 more at even. Seriously the US Open might have more guys in the red. The lack of trees may make for fewer blocked shots, but wind, water and length all mixed to bring the \u201cmonster\u201d moniker back to Doral. The Donald took this over and while the TV couldn\u2019t get enough of him you have to give the guy credit who apparently played a large role in the redesign. Food for thought \u2013 he wants to add more water for 2015. Have fun guys.\nRory, Adam, Tiger \u2013 Talk about a mega letdown. Pair the top 3 in the world for the first 2 rounds and they just sucked. Combined for only 2 rounds under par between the 3 of them and while Tiger shot up the leaderboard on moving day with his 66 his back (and insanely inconsistent game) let him down on Sunday. All 3 finished T-25 at +5. I expect more from these guys and honestly so does the majority of people watching, not to mention the TV execs. Need to step it up boys.\nBut when the going gets tough, what I really love is that it really shows me the golfers who have balls. Sure, you can be mentally tough when you\u2019re 5 under, but what about when your goal on every hole is par; how do you handle that? Can you grind it out and be patient for 18 holes? Because at the end of the day, they all play the same course, and those that handle that mental side of things the best, tend to get the best results. It\u2019s why a guy like Graeme McDowell can make up 30 places in the leaderboard just by hanging tough with a -1 round on Friday. I will gladly root for guys like that all day. It\u2019s going to be a good weekend of golf.\nNo use trying to commentate on the Friday carnage at Doral. This sums it up just fine.\nI'd bet $1000 to any \"scratch\" golfer that they wouldn't break 90 on that course today.\nYa the breeze was quite strong today\ud83d\udca8 RT @jtedscott: Can you say windy? #3-197 hole, PW 205 yds. #4-211 hole, 3 iron 175.\nOne major champion stud walked off course with a smile and said, \u201cWow. I got my a** kicked.\u201d He\u2019s not alone.\nReally tough day at the office, even had 1 of the spectators try 2 nick my golf ball on the 10th! Luckily thr is always tmr! #82 #Only9back!\nWhen it comes to locks and golf, we here at Under the Number tend to get a little competitive. As Steve mentioned in his Locks blog last week, he is tracking his successes and failures in terms of dollars. As a fellow wagerer, I could not pass up on the opportunity to make my own bets and see how I stack up against our resident gaming expert. I will spare you my nonsensical thoughts related to the \u201cwhy\u201d when it comes to my picks, just know that all of these are rooted in hours of strenuous research\u2026.\nAfter a few cocktails the other day Steve, myself and another friend found ourselves flipping through the channels when we landed on pure golf dude gold \u2026 Big Break Florida. Now I\u2019m not a fan of reality TV. Sure maybe the first Survivor was interesting and growing up you could waste some time watching the original season of Road Rules and the Real World, but with most of TV filled with self-important reality crap these days I could really care less. But Big Break Florida is an exception. Group of pretty attractive women (for the most part), competing in various golf challenges, in very small outfits \u2026 winning all around.\nNow this isn\u2019t great TV and certainly it isn\u2019t even great golf, but it is just another example of the Golf Channel completely understanding their target demographic. These women, their outfits and the commercials for Johnny Walker are not a lucky coincidence. Just like Holly Sonders and Lauren Thompson aren\u2019t mistakes and lucky casting choices on Morning Drive.\nListen I\u2019m not going to complain about any of this, but these folks know what they are doing and can count on this loyal viewer to keep watching. (FYI: Big Break FL on at 9 PM on Mondays). You\u2019re welcome!\nHey, thanks Rory. Looked like I was going to have a nice $800 payday last week before Rory threw up all over himself\u2026 again. I think long term this is a good thing for Rory, but for my bank account, not so much.\nI\u2019m sure Scott will be a popular pick this week but I\u2019m rolling with him because he has a perfect trifecta of ingredients that I think are important that week.\n1) He has great course history at Doral. He\u2019s finished T-6 or better twice in his last three starts. I know it is not the same course, but it certainly doesn\u2019t hurt.\n2) Not every hole has change and he has the best, most experienced caddie in the game.\n3) He\u2019s playing really well. Had 4 rounds under par last week at a tough PGA National. He is right on schedule.\nThere\u2019s no question he is a huge risk this week, but with no cut at Doral I love him in a one-and-done type of league. There are a ton of reasons why I like him this week. First, nobody has a tournament history on this course, so any advantage the veterans may have on him this week is basically gone. If anything, Jordan may have an advantage because he skipped the Honda to play practice rounds over the weekend in Miami. I LOVE how he played in his best finish of the year, a T-4 at the AT&T, after shooting a 78 on Saturday. He battled back with a 67 on Sunday. I know he had a mini-mental breakdown at the match play, but I\u2019m not worried about it. This kid is going to win a big one soon.\nI just love the value. Steve crushes top 10s. Crushes them. He played 13 events last year and was top 10 in 8 of them. Invest.\nCertainly a gamble, but I\u2019m going to bet on his recent form. He played well at the match play before getting bounced in a close match with Jason Dufner and was T-13 last week at the Honda after a final round 67 (tied for best of the day).\nDARREN FICHARDT- Top 10 (21-1) $50 to win $1050 I have an unhealthy love for South African golfers in big events so it\u2019s really a natural fit for me. Darren has been a on a nice little run recently on the Euro tour with two top 10\u2019s in his last two events. The Euros seems to do well in WGC events, and at this price, a worth investment.", "version": "v0"}

Forgive me for being fight club-esque as, that is not nearly my intention. Things just strike you in that moment, while you look out the window and watch the world slowly shrink below you. The waters and trees and seas of water recede slowly out of sight, and you suddenly feel a lot bigger than you were moments before. You feel like you're bigger and it feels nice to be able to sit back and watch the world spin slowly below you, though you're actually moving much faster than you would be driving even a race car.\nThis is when you pass through the clouds. As a novice, you get that small panic as you pass through the clouds and all goes dark and sad. You brace for turbulence that never comes.

Or you could enjoy the travel because you are moving, and you believe in movement change and second chances. It could feel good because you're going to your other other home. It's called home because of the way it looks, the way that you feel when you walk in and everything isn't strange and new. The feeling that you're sort of welcome, and that people sort of want you there. This is what home is and it feels sort of nice to know you're going back.\nIf you've stopped to wonder at this point whether it should feel nice and comfy where you're going, you were quickly distracted by something else, and it didn't matter much. Thing is, you can't let yourself think about what you feel like deep deep down. Sure you think lots. You think all the time and you think more than you should. But it's not deep deep down, because deep deep down is where you get hurt by what people say and do behind your back, and in front of your back, assumed that your back ends somewhere on the front of your body, and being in front of it, would mean facing you.\nI suppose that's enough rambling.\nLove the Fight Club-esque feel.\nIs that what home is like for some people?

James and Per talk to Bruno Figueiredo and look back at UX in 2009 and speculate about UX design in 2029.\nPER: We have listeners in 182 countries from Togo to Kenya.\nJAMES: We\u2019ve got our own little variation of the 10 year challenge for you today. In our 200th episode, Lisa asked Per and I about the future of the podcast and UX. In that show we gave a brief answer about design and I focused quite a bit on legislation. Today, though, we thought we\u2019d expand the topic a bit. And in our own 10-year challenge we\u2019re going to take a look towards the year 2029.\nPER: And to help us do just that, we\u2019re joined by Bruno Figueiredo. Bruno for the past 10 years has been curating and organizing one of our favorite conferences, the UXLx Conference in Lisbon. And I believe doing that and having attended as many of those conferences as we have, we understand that he has actually hand-selected a lot of people from a different broad wide areas of industries and people that may not even have identified them as UXers. And in that sense, for me, I think Bruno has even set the stage for some of the paths that people have chosen.\nI know that Alastair Somerville did not identify as a UXer the first time we met him at UXLx and our most recent interviews that we released from the past UXLx with Kathryn McElroy with the Arduino prototyping \u2013 he\u2019s pushing the boundary of UXers. I kind of love what he\u2019s doing with that conference.\nJAMES: Yes, I didn\u2019t recognize myself as a UXer until I started going to UXLx.\nJAMES: Absolutely. I think Bruno has been filling the pores of our industry and reading what people want to learn about and hear about for of the past decade. So it feels a good choice to join us in this topic show.\nSo we\u2019re three middle-aged men now, can we remember as far back as 2009?\nBRUNO: I think I still can. It\u2019s not very far away.\nJAMES: You\u2019re very confident, Bruno.\nPER: It\u2019s kind of blurry, though. I mean, from 2002 to 2011 probably kind of blurry.\nJAMES: Well, it does get blurry because you don\u2019t remember exactly when certain things did happen. But 2009, so we\u2019ve got iPhones \u2013 we started to get the smartphones and iPhones but we\u2019ve not got as far as responsive web design, have we?\nPER: But at least we\u2019re not designing with tables anymore.\nJAMES: Most of us have moved on from tables. And Flash by then, as well \u2013 that\u2019s pretty much dead by 2009, I guess?\nBRUNO: Well, if you\u2019re talking iPhone, I mean, iPhone kind of killed Flash. There were lots of debates in the beginning because iPhone didn\u2019t support Flash. YouTube used Flash around that time.\nBRUNO: And I think it lingered on for quite a bit after that as well.\nJAMES: But how we were working back in 2009?\nBRUNO: Well, I think one of the main differences is nowadays we use mobile devices quite a lot more so maybe accessing the web these days might be primarily done with mobiles rather than desktops. And I think that\u2019s quite a big change.\nJAMES: You\u2019re absolutely right about that, Bruno. I know back in 2009 \u2013 for one, I wasn\u2019t calling my self a UXer of any form and we weren\u2019t doing mobile first and we weren\u2019t testing websites primarily on mobile or even at all on mobile. So absolutely, the way of working in that sense, I think, has changed a massive amount given were we\u2019re putting our design focus.\nPER: I think that\u2019s probably around the time when sliders started becoming popular, sliders on the home page.\nBRUNO: Yes, I remember one of the first workshops we did at UXLx was something about using rich interactions like we would call them those days. So we were just starting moving on from mostly static web where you had to click on something to refresh the entire screen and moving into asynchronous paradigm. In 2009 we were just getting to that, and that changed the way immensely.\nJAMES: Yes, of course, around that period we were thick in the whole Ajax time of things, weren\u2019t we. We were just getting to the point where we could dynamically update pages.\nJAMES: But you Bruno, you\u2019ve got kind of a unique situation. You\u2019ve been spending 10 years now watching the world of design to see what we\u2019re all interested in learning so that you can pull in people for UX conferences and workshops. So apart from the mobile side of things, what else have you noticed has been a big change in what people are after?\nBRUNO: I think in the beginning almost everyone that was doing UX kind of landed into it coming from all sorts of different places. So the discussion for the first two years was focused about what do we do, what are we? A little bit existentialist. And I think when we stopped doing that we started to have more specialized roles, and new things emerged like, sort of, this design, like content strategy. So people started focusing on different specializations of the UX field. And I think we\u2019re still doing that. The field is splitting into a very more specialized streams.\nJAMES: Per and I are acutely aware of the whole thing about how much conversation that was around who we are, the existential side of things. That\u2019s what inspired the whole start of the podcast. I don\u2019t think that has gone away. It\u2019s just that we\u2019ve got other things occupying our time, I think. So it isn\u2019t the most dominating of topics nowadays.\nPER: I think we were trying to figure out who we were. We were also struggling for more power. I was looking for my LinkedIn profile and realized that 2009 was actually the year that I attended a UX intensive training course by Adaptive Path that was run in Berlin at that time. And it was design strategy and design research and it was about taking your design practice to the next level.\nSo I think before that we were basically just providers of a design to someone else. But whereas we now have matured so much that we\u2019re actually in charge of the design in another way. So it\u2019s the maturity. I think it\u2019s a big difference. And that\u2019s also what\u2019s allowing us, of course, to split into smaller and smaller segments. Everyone is becoming more specialized around these issues.\nJAMES: Yes, you\u2019ve got the fact that 2009, I didn\u2019t work in the agile teams or I didn\u2019t\u2019 work intrusively, I guess, we\u2019re developing things. I mean, every single thing, I guess, I worked on back then was sit down, work out what we wanted, and then start producing it. Or go through the laborious process of choosing the agency to come and do the end production. You didn\u2019t just get on with it yourself, you had to go through that procurement process of finding someone.\nAnd then that whole dance of, \u201cHave they done the right thing, have they done the wrong thing? Who\u2019s going to change it? Do we have to pay for them to change it?\u201d So that\u2019s a massive difference. You must notice that too, Bruno \u2013 running and agency.\nBRUNO: Yes, I think in 2009 we as a community, we all agreed what the right process of working would be. And it took a while until we all started effectively doing everything that we preached back in those days. So I think that that\u2019s one difference. I don\u2019t think that at least, the market was fully ready to accommodate for everything that we wanted to do for the entire process that we were outlining those days.\nJAMES: That\u2019s probably still true. I thin organisations, at least the ones I\u2019ve come into contact with, they find it challenging to, for example, by sprints rather than buy an app or by a website. It\u2019s a challenging concept to get your head around paying for as an organisation, I think.\nPER: And this is just the case, I mean, we\u2019re just stretching out the maturity. Some practitioners and organizations will still be around where we\u2019re talking about to 2009 whereas others have moved on quite far to actually having their whole in-house UX organizations with a product manager on top of them running it like its own business but within the company.\nJAMES: That\u2019s really good to flip out 10-year challenge forward. So now we\u2019re in 2029, we\u2019ve jumped in our time ship and gone forward. Where are we at now? What\u2019s are the major changes we expect to our work as UXers? We will even be UXers in 10 years\u2019 time?\nBRUNO: It\u2019s a good question. I think so. I think it\u2019s established itself even though the meaning might be slightly different. I think that in 2029 what we will be focusing on will be different kinds of interactions. I think in the past 10 years the interaction on web evolved a lot to a point \u2013 I don\u2019t know I there\u2019s much more we can do to increase the quality of interaction on the web from a technology standpoint. But in 10 years I think we\u2019ll start seeing entirely new ways of interaction that go a little beyond the desktop. And we\u2019re starting to see that now.\nWith the focus on virtual reality, augmented reality I think in 10 years augmented reality will be a big part of our lives if we can manage out the weight of the interface to access it. I think that\u2019s the largest drawback for that kind of technology.\nJAMES: Virtual reality, I don\u2019t think that will take off again. We\u2019ve talked about in previous episodes about the usefulness of augmented reality. That perhaps is going to be something that takes hold in the workplace and so on. But I\u2019m not sure exactly how the mass adoption side of augmented will be. I think, there, we\u2019re going to be landing in more very specific applications to enhance something a little bit.\nI don\u2019t see us all walking round with Google Glass attached to us.\nBRUNO: Well, maybe not that, and certainly the devices that we have nowadays in the market \u2013 they are big and cumbersome to us. I don\u2019t think people will update around these. But I hope there will be new devices emerging that will be streamlined, lighter. As with you, I don\u2019t believe virtual reality is something that has much of a future besides game. But augmented reality is really where I see we could advance the signs of interaction. I was just watching a movie on Vimeo the other day called Sight. It\u2019s a short movie but it has a vision similar to what I think will happen in a couple of years.\nSo if you have high definition screen right in front of your eyes and you can project anything on to it, you don\u2019t need screens anymore. And I just revisited, a few days ago, a video that Microsoft did 10 years ago. You know, one of those vision videos they put out every now and then. And it was mostly about screens and paper-like screens. But you touching physical screens everywhere. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll actually get to that because screens dematerialize sooner than we expect with the advancements in the field of augmented reality.\nBut as I said, the biggest drawback is finding the good interface for some really light glasses or something because I don\u2019t believe the answer is using your smartphone and pointing at things and looking kind of, like, through a keyhole like we do today because that\u2019s cumbersome. But when you start thinking about materializing screens and maybe feeding information from IoT devices into that as layers of information in front of your eyes I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re heading.\nPER: I can see myself walking around with a contact lens. I mean, if you could fit this technology into a contact lens that takes you a second to put in and take out. Certainly. But I\u2019m always afraid of where that will take us. I\u2019m always imagining stuff. So yes, it\u2019s great if I\u2019m walking to the bus and I can see a timetable for the bus in front of my. If I can look at my child and see vital signs like their pulse and fever. But also then what would happen in the workplace if I\u2019m looking at people and I can see their names, their age, their heartbeat. Will I detect, oh, is that person lying? Will I start wondering things like that?\nWhere will the information \u2013 how will we make sure that people can stay private in a world like this because face recognition will also of course be adopted by any type of screen that we have in front of us all the time.\nJAMES: That ties in with what me and you were saying in Episode 200 when Lisa asked us a question that we answered with legislation was the main thing that I thought will come and affect us. Thinking about what we\u2019re saying now \u2013 well Bruno you said that we may be reaching a technological limit with what we can do with interaction. But there, I think, we\u2019ve still got a huge amount to go when it comes to accessibility when it comes to the interaction. We may have designed stuff really nicely but implementing it, we\u2019re falling away short.\nAnd then when we start talking about augmented reality and screens and the visual side of things. There, again, will we be wanting or forced to make things inclusive going forward? So in ten years, will society want to have a dividing piece of technology? Something that excludes huge chunks of society because it\u2019s just not possible to use for certain groups of people around us.\nBRUNO: Well, it\u2019s certainly a problem for vision-impaired people but for people without disabilities just imagine that they could be talking with someone and being able to read instant captions on what are they talking. So in some ways, yes, it can be a little more dividing but also more inclusive to other people with disabilities.\nJAMES: But I think that kind of thing, though, where the technology becomes kind of a layer of something that is a service layer. It\u2019s not actually something that maybe we\u2019ll have to design or we\u2019ll have to work with designers because instant captioning will be a service layer that we just employ in the things that we create. Maybe even some of the augmented aspect that we\u2019re talking about, whether it\u2019s augmented vision or augmented hearing some of these things maybe will be service layers.\nSo they\u2019re not what we\u2019re going to be working with designers.\nBRUNO: I\u2019m not sure if entirely agree with it because I think in the future, designers will be more involved in business processes. So the experience \u2013 and we\u2019re starting to reach this stage nowadays the business layer of the services we design, automation and artificial intelligence. I think that will need to be designed as well. So everything that happens behind the screen will need to be designed in the way that it\u2019s not visual but it\u2019s part of the service.\nPER: Part of the choice architecture.\nPER: What choices will be offered to the user? When you say automation there, that makes me think, so what parts of what we\u2019re doing today will be able to become automated in the future?\nJAMES: That\u2019s a good point. Generative design is one of the phrases that\u2019s used where machines produce many, many design variation for us and perhaps even choose or suggest the right one or we, maybe, then help them decide the final one.\nPER: Historically, I mean, we\u2019ve been pretty bad at understanding human behavior. Maybe we can design a machine that can understand humans better than we can understand ourselves. Depending on what goals you\u2019re setting for that machine, what will be the purpose of the machine? And that\u2019s the things that keep me awake at night. We will decide the value system of the machine.\nBRUNO: I think one of the large difference that we\u2019re walking into is technology is ever more personal. Nowadays, if someone sees you using your mobile or your tablet, it\u2019s a personal experience that they\u2019re witnessing on the side, they don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, they can only assume that maybe you\u2019re eating or watching a video. But when we move into personal augmented reality, you have your own world there that no one can peek into.\nSo it\u2019s a never more personal experience. The layers of information that you choose to use, they both can be projected into the same physical space. But they would be two different realities.\nPER: Yeah, I can\u2019t remember.\nJAMES: I can only hear Laurel so I\u2019ve forgotten what the other one is.\nJAMES: Yanny and Laurel. So everyone has got these variations of reality, then, you know, you can have conversations were you don\u2019t truly understand the variation of reality you\u2019re talking to that\u2019s perceived by the other side of the conversation. But I\u2019m getting into some of the practical challenges of stuff that we\u2019re imagining.\nI mean, we\u2019ve talked an awful lot these last few years about chat-bots and voice interfaces. What do we think about that in 10 years\u2019 time?\nPER: We have been talking about voice interfaces since the early \u201890s or even before that. Bill Gates has predicted it many, many times that \u201cNext year, next year.\u201d My problem with voice interfaces is that I live in a family where everyone can control everything. And I wouldn\u2019t walk around if everybody is just talking to the devices when they\u2019re walking. I can\u2019t see where it will be used. I have so much trouble understanding the application of voice interfaces.\nI mean, I still use it for turning on lights, for scheduling an appointment in my calendar, sure. For command and control, stuff like that. I can see a use for it, absolutely.\nBRUNO: I think as we evolve in that field \u2014 I think some people and some cultures are not as comfortable with talking to machines as others. And I think the main thing is that we\u2019re still very much aware that we\u2019re talking to a machine, particularly when the machine doesn\u2019t understand you. So if their technology gets better I think that people will start engaging more with it and it won\u2019t feel as much as we\u2019re talking with a machine.\nJAMES: I actually think maybe it\u2019s the tech side of this which will be a bigger thing in ten years. I\u2019m basing this on the fact that there\u2019s report after report now that\u2019s saying about how the new generations are \u2013 the less likely they are to ring people, to talk to people, to have voice conversations. So any interaction with an authority or a company, they prefer to do it via writing rather than talking. So perhaps 10 years\u2019 time there will be a huge shift of \u2013 conversational transactions will be texted-based.\nBRUNO: I think so. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the synchronous nature of it. In a world where we\u2019re ever more busy and doing things, asynchronous communication fits better than synchronous modes like the telephone.\nPER: So when you say there, Bruno \u2013 you say in a world that is ever more busy, going back in time we thought we would come to a place in the future we wouldn\u2019t have to work as much and it seems like we\u2019re working more and more. So when we\u2019re trying to predict the future, what are we actually trying to do? Are we trying to think of the things that would help us work more or work less or be more comfortable or less comfortable? For me, there\u2019s something wrong in how we \u2013 do we want to create more stuff and for what purpose?\nWhat is it that people will actually be demanding of designers in the future? Will there be a backlash where people understand that they have been manipulated by designers for many years in the sense that people are using cognitive tricks to actually force people \u2013 in a choice architecture fashion, force people to at least make choices that may be better for them, harder to make.\nI\u2019m seeing that people will actually be more weary of technology in the future because we\u2019ve been treating people in a bad way.\nJAMES: I think so too Per. We\u2019re already starting to see the information backlash. I thin people\u2019s knowledge is starting to rise about what information is potentially gathered and how stuff can be used. Although it\u2019s an incredibly complex thing for a lot of people to get their head around. What you can do with information at scale. But looking at how people are reacting to Facebook and some of the big operators; Google and so on.\nWhat I\u2019m hoping is that we\u2019ll see something like Tim Berners Lee\u2019s solid project or if Microsoft had launched their own kind of idea of \u2013 the idea where your information will be contained in a digital entity which you then control how this is distributed and loaned out to other parties rather than the model we\u2019ve got at the moment where Facebook and Google and Amazon basically own every single bit of data about you and they decide, effectively, who by and large gets to play with it.\nIf that situation is coming to play in 10 years\u2019 time then that will make a massive difference to how we conceptualise things that we\u2019re working on, how we design things that we\u2019re working on. Because it will flip the data model.\nBRUNO: And a few years ago I think it was Clay Shirky there is no information overload, there is only futile failure. That\u2019s one thing that we suddenly need is to have better filters for information in the future. I think that\u2019s going to be a huge challenge.\nPER: And a kill switch, a kill switch for my technology sometimes when I want to break. So there was this excellent piece of tech that I actually saw the other day. I forget what it\u2019s called and it was tweeted by Alan Cooper. It was a device that you actually put on top of your Alexa and it takes over, and it emits a sound into the Alexa microphones so the Alexa can\u2019t listen in on everything you\u2019re saying. And then you can set your own activation phrase for that device, and that device will translate that to activating the Alexa. Which means that you\u2019re actually blocking Alexa from doing what they designed it to do and you\u2019re deciding what the Alexa will do for you.\nSo I think that type of technology will be interesting as well to, actually, people selling technology that will keep your data safe.\nJAMES: You see, there\u2019s just so many fascinating things you could get into here. It\u2019s probably out of the scope of this podcast today but just the whole medical side of technology advancement as well. Imagine the time where someone operates in their voice cords a noise cancelling enhancement so that you\u2019re permanently not being able to be picked up some of these devices.\nBRUNO: You did start a good point. Health. I think health and technology and the way you see advancement into personal technology that tracks your health like smart watches and other devices, I think that\u2019s going to be a challenge for the next 10 years. I think we\u2019ll start seeing a lot more medical devices tracking you and having those in your home. I think we\u2019ll start seeing small diagnostics devices that you\u2019ll have at home to take care of your health.\nJAMES: You\u2019re completely right there. As far as \u2013 kind of, if we had a sure hand, how many of us are working with health related design? I think we\u2019re going to see a lot more hands rise up. Because it\u2019s a pure numbers game in 10 years\u2019 time. There\u2019s a world of baby boomers born in the \u201840s who are going to be seriously in need of more healthcare. That means there will be more demand, like you say for some of these health care issues. Which means there will be more design for these healthcare things.\nSo I think that\u2019s one of the few things we can probably, with great confidence, predict for 2029 is that we\u2019re going to have a lot more UXers working with health.\nPER: And me myself having worked with health things for seven years now I completely agree. It\u2019s just growing and growing and growing and suppliers are just struggling to get into this area all the time.\nBRUNO: One other thing that I think is going to be massive in 10 years is the holistic design process and how \u2013 nowadays we\u2019re working in service design. But we\u2019re working in service design in a way it\u2019s tied to the company that hired us to do that. But companies are ever more working with other companies. So how does the experience evolve when there are other players in between and how do the services of one company connect with the services of another company that they didn\u2019t even expect to be intertwined in the first place.\nSo I think that\u2019s going to be a challenge.\nJAMES: Well, I think we\u2019ve pretty much wrapped up 2029 and 2009. Spanning 20 years. 20-year challenge in the end.\nPER: Yes, there will be stuff for us to work on. That\u2019s a definite. There are so many challenges out there and it\u2019s impossible to know what direction we\u2019ll take. But the important thing for me is that we\u2019ll actually keep being the voice of the users, the voice of the humans and being even more than human-centric, even human-considerate.\nJAMES: No matter what happens with technology, I think our role is still going to be as guardians of that interface between humans and machine. Thanks for joining us today, Bruno, and helping us out with this topic.\nBRUNO: Thank you for having me.\nPER: Robbing the piggy bank again.\nThis is a transcript of a conversation between James Royal-Lawson, Per Axbom and Bruno Figueiredo recorded in January 2019 and published as Episode 203 of UX Podcast.", "version": "v0"}

I have been researching the use of sulfur in managing adhesions/ scar tissue where joints are not in full use. The sulfur in this product is what interested me and separated this product from so many others. I have been using it for about three weeks now and am noticing a great reduction in pain.

Your brain adjusts the way it releases its chemicals according to the tricky dictates of Caffeine. So, when you abruptly cut off your Caffeine intake, there are going to be consequences. As many people have discovered, Caffeine has some pretty nasty withdrawal symptoms.\nHeadaches \u2014 The most notorious of the Caffeine withdrawal symptoms. Not just a mild headache, a severe, throbbing headache that can make it difficult to function.\nCause: Caffeine narrows the blood vessels in your brain. When you stop the brain\u2019s steady supply of Caffeine, it brings on increases in the velocity of the blood flow according to a study that used EEG and Ultrasound to observe changes in the brain after cutting off Caffeine intake.\nRelieving the Symptom: There are ways to ease the severity of one of the worse symptoms of Caffeine withdrawal.\nThe first is obvious. Take an over-the-counter pain medication according to package instructions until the pain subsides. Taking a pain medication that has Caffeine as one of its ingredients will reduce the pain faster. But, there\u2019s a downside. It will add to your dependence. Consuming Caffeine of any kind will have the same result.\nMassaging your temples with peppermint oil can be helpful in relieving some pain and pressure.\nDrink plenty of water. Increasing your water intake will keep the Brain hydrated.\nRest. Get enough Even try cat-napping during the day. It can bring relief.\nCut back slowly. You get less severe withdrawal symptoms when you cut back slowly instead of all at once.\nDepression and Anxiety \u2014 Caffeine withdrawal can cause mood changes including Depression and Anxiety. This varies in intensity and in some cases require clinical intervention. If you have a history of Depression, talk to your doctor about your intention to stop taking Caffeine.\nCauses: Since Caffeine has altered your Brain\u2019s chemicals, any change in its intake will elicit changes. Stopping caffeine causes Serotonin levels in your brain to drop. Since Caffeine withdrawal may cause Insomnia and Depression is often worsened by sleeplessness, this can represent a big problem during your Detox.\nRelieving the Symptom: The best way to lessen or in some cases prevent Caffeine withdrawal symptoms is to reduce Caffeine intake over time rather than abruptly stopping. Include regular exercise in your daily routine. Exercise causes the release of Endorphins which elevate the mood.\nAnxiety & Irritability \u2014 Caffeine is a stimulant enabler that changes the way the brain operates. It causes increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and stress hormones. Halting Caffeine intake may cause you to be irritable and have a short fuse. If you were a heavy Caffeine user, that fuse is even shorter.\nCauses: Caffeine increases the amount of Dopamine your Brain produces. When the effects of that neurotransmitter are cut off, the result is a lowered, grumpy mood. Since your body has become physiologically dependent on it, stopping the supply may create Anxiety. You don\u2019t feel good and your mood shows it.\nRelieving the Symptom: Reduce your intake over time rather than an abrupt halt. To reduce all caffeine withdrawal symptoms, cut back slowly, and increase your water intake. Practicing Meditation and Yoga are often helpful in relieving Anxiety.\nConstipation \u2014 After you cut off Caffeine, your body\u2019s eliminatory system may take a turn for the worse. You may start to have problems with Constipation.\nCauses: Caffeine stimulates your bowel movement. Without it, the body needs to adjust to taking care of that task without any stimulation.\nRelieving the Symptom \u2014 Pay extra attention to your nutritional intake. Increase the amount of fiber you consume each day and increase the amount of water you drink. If you don\u2019t have one, start a daily exercise routine. If you\u2019re uncomfortable, an over-the-counter laxative will bring faster relief.\nFatigue \u2014 A common withdrawal symptom of Caffeine is fatigue and sluggishness. You just don\u2019t have any get up and go and it\u2019s a struggle just moving through your regular activities.\nCauses: The Caffeine you were taking blocked the Adenosine in your brain, causing you not to feel tired or drowsy. Blocking the Adenosine from its natural function caused other brain chemicals to go into overdrive. Caffeine withdrawal causes drowsiness and fatigue because you\u2019ve weaned your body from all those excess stimulants Caffeine enabled.\nRelieving the Symptoms: Maintain a healthy nutritious diet, drink at least eight glasses of water daily water, and exercise regularly.\nLower Concentration \u2014 Caffeine can produce sharper focus, hyper-alertness, and give you the boost you need to study for an exam or handle a demanding job. Once you stop taking it, you may find it harder to concentrate and focus your attention on the intensity you desire.\nCauses: Caffeine causes an increase in the levels of Adrenaline the Adrenals produce. Once you stop taking it, the adrenaline boost, along with the boosts you got from other chemicals like Norepinephrine and Dopamine are also gone. The combined overproduction of all these chemicals is what raised your alertness while you were taking Caffeine. Without them, your body must become accustomed to relying on normal focus to concentrate adequately.\nRelieving the Symptom: Practicing Mindful Meditation increases focus and awareness. A daily exercise activity like jogging, spending time at the gym, or other physical exercise can also help.\nHow Long Does Caffeine Withdrawal Take?\nThe length of time it takes you to completely Detox from Caffeine varies from person to person. You can expect the process to complete within two to nine days. For heavy Caffeine users, the withdrawal can take longer, in some cases, months. You\u2019ll begin to experience Caffeine withdrawal symptoms between a half day to an entire day after you last consume any Caffeine. You\u2019ll probably be impacted the most by symptoms between the first 24 and 51 hours.\nIs Caffeine Withdrawal a Mental Disorder?\nYears of research prompted some scientists to claim Caffeine Withdrawal fits all the criteria to be classified as a psychiatric disorder. Studies show as little as a single cup of coffee is enough to produce addiction in some people. Withdrawal from Caffeine produces often intense withdrawal symptoms. The intensity of the symptoms varies from person to person. A small percentage of people are disabled by withdrawal and prevented from going about their daily activities. Not everyone agrees with this. Caffeine Withdrawal was not included in the DSM-V because there is no evidence there is a significant amount of people disabled by the symptoms.\nHow Much Caffeine Can You Consume Before Becoming Addicted?\nIt\u2019s impossible to say exactly how long a Caffeine addiction requires taking hold. A rough estimate is an addiction can set in between 7 and 14 days of daily consumption. Caffeine changes the chemical composition of the brain. So, the length of time it will take for you to become addicted depends on how long it takes your brain to determine it needs Caffeine for your survival.\nCaffeine is carried to the brain via the bloodstream. The structure of caffeine is close to a natural molecule called Adenosine. Brain receptors easily mistake Caffeine for Adenosine. Caffeine blocks Adenosine. Adenosine causes you to feel a sense of fatigue or weariness. This is why Caffeine produces a feeling of being alert and wide awake. Another change caused by the blocked Adenosine molecules and their buildup outside the receptors is it prompts the adrenal glands to secrete the stimulant, Adrenaline. Blocked Adenosine also causes Dopamine to increase production.\nIronically, the belief that Caffeine is an actual stimulant is false. It simply enables other natural stimulants. It hacks the brain by creating a block that causes the brain\u2019s natural stimulants to run amok. A steady infusion of caffeine allows the brain to become accustomed to this state of being. This is why when you attempt to cut off caffeine, your body goes through withdrawal.", "version": "v0"}

In the event it isn\u2019t managed properly and arrested in timely fashion, by seeking professional help, this drug induced rabbit hole can spiral down into dreaded outcomes which include but are not limited to; emotional and physical abuse, job loss, depression, financial ruin and in the extreme cases, health crisis and eventually death.\nDrugs and a loving relationship blend about as well as a keg of gasoline and a match stick. The combination can be undoubtedly explosive and the destruction catastrophic spreading far beyond the confines of the abuser and his immediate family, which can equally have a detrimental effect to society as a whole. Substance abuse and its negative effect on our society can further be proven, by a recent report which provides a current estimate of how much America is paying for drug and alcohol abuse. It is said to be at a whopping $416 billion each year.\nThere is a thin line between recreational substance abuse and addiction. Most times those lines are blurred, with really no clear differentiation. But what really is addiction? Addiction could be said to be; the habitual or compulsive use of drugs (prescribe or non-prescribed) or alcohol in the face of undesirable physical, social and mental consequences and outcomes.\nThe good news is, regardless of the demography or dynamics of the substance abuse, regardless of the fact if only one partner in the relationship or both parties are involved in the compulsive behavior, there is a lasting solution in sight in couples therapy, and the road to recovery is just a call or a mouse click away, but the conscious decision has to come from within. Are you ready to detox your relationship together as a couple? Couples drug rehabs offer the ability for individual to enter into a recovery program as a team. This way, by going to rehab as a couple you and your partner can support each other along the way.\nAccording to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), a staggering 21.5 million American adult aged 12 and older battled with one form of substance abuse or the other. Approximately 14.5 million adults aged 26 or older struggled with a substance use disorder. Despite marijuana and prescription drugs such as \u2013 pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedative being abused at a high rate, alcohol still remains the most abused addictive substance in America, this report is according to the National Council of Alcoholism and Drug dependence (NCADD).\nWhat does all these statistics and figures signify? It means you are not alone in this struggle, and the helplessness and isolation you are feeling is a false sense of reality, which you can snap out of this very moment.\nAt What Point Should Couples Seek Help?\nMarriage and relationships as a collective is no bed of roses. It is a rollercoaster ride ridden with ups and downs, triumph and trials, hurt and happiness, fights, argument and forgiveness which the couples have to perpetually work hard to maintain and also dodge the several curve balls life would naturally throw at them. Nevertheless, committed relationships could be called beautiful imperfections.\nBut this beautiful struggle can easily take a wrong turn and morph into a living hell on earth with the inclusion of substance abuse as an extra factor to an already complicated equation.\nStints of unhappiness are totally normal in any union, heck life and its unpredictable nature comes with a periodic wave of misery and misfortune. But couples in which one partner or both engage in substance abuse (alcohol and/or drugs) become severely unhappy and distant, in contrast to their sober counterparts. As the continuous cycle of drug use festers, with no recourse to couples drug rehab; this starts to take a toll on the fabrics of their relationships and chips away chunks of the love, trust and happiness that once existed in abundance.\nThere are several symptoms that appear when a relationship starts to deteriorate due to incessant drug and alcohol abuse. Some of which include but are not limited to the following examples; (1) heated arguments and fights which most times turn violent, (2) an emotional and physical disconnect on one or both partners, (3) suspicion and irrational paranoia (which is usually fuelled by the drug intake), (5) distrust, lies and hopelessness, (6) inability to discharge work or family obligations and responsibilities effectively, (7) display of affection and attention is hinged on the drug induced highness of one or both couples, (8) drinking or drug use is the only or among the few things the couple enjoy doing together, and etc.\nEventually other pertinent issues would be ignored and the substance abuse would assume center stage of the problems in the relationship, causing more confrontation and conflict. At this point the environment becomes toxic, unbearable and a catch 22 situation is created by default. Because the drug abuse causes the fights and arguments, which then leads to an increased use in the illicit substances as a form or an excuse to escape from dealing with the issues, which will in turn then causes more aggravated conflict. If you\u2019re in this situation that feels like both of you are threading a Ferris wheel, with only one or two of the symptoms visibly present, then it is time to seek help in a rehab that accepts couples.\nWhat Are The Best Options For You and Your Partner?\nIt is important to note that couple\u2019s therapy or drug rehab is only a pit stop, on your road to recovery. It isn\u2019t the final destination and it is definitely not a magic wand. It took years to cultivate and nurse this habit; it will take a considerable amount of effort and sheer zeal by the individual and the couple to work at being substance independent, even after detox and therapy is administered \u2013 don\u2019t fret, you can definitely walk the walk!\nConventional forms and approaches to drug rehabilitation places emphasis on individual therapy and rehabilitation program, but modern research proves that couple relationship contributes significantly to in addiction recovery. According to a report released by couplesrecovery.org: divorce rates are higher than normal for couples who report substance misuse problems.\nAlthough many therapy facilities adopt individual-based therapy, this approach is ineffective specifically if the other partner is also fighting drug addiction. Drug addiction therapy for couples in a rehab that has the facilities and proven support programs that are unique, research and result driven would be the best option to quick recovery.\nIf only one member in the relationship goes into rehab, the drug or alcohol habit of the unwilling half, regardless of the quality of care and therapy received by the partner in rehab will serve as a catalyst for relapse even after adequate progress and treatment has been given.\nIf both parties in the relationship go into rehab together, the program will definitely furnish the couple with the necessary tool that will enable them learn how to recover together and sustain their sobriety. Every addiction has its triggers, weaknesses and cravings; comprehension of these details individually or as a couple does go a long way to preventing relapse post recovery. The treatment can also help foster a new dynamics in the union that will help mitigate issues such as colluding, codependence or enabling the drug or substance abuse dependence.\nAccording to a recent report from the Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy demonstrates that a positive relationship can be a motivating factor in both achieving and maintaining recovery. The manner and module of treatment applied would depend on the peculiar needs of each couple or relationship.\nWhat Role Can A Spouse Play In Addiction And Recovery?\nOne impeccable force that could either loosen or fasten the knot of love is addiction. Although marriages in which one or both partners engage in substance abuse are more likely to four to seven times more likely to end in separation, unconditional spousal support and understanding nevertheless remains a major remedy to full recovery with your marriage intact. This also applies to unmarried couples who are committed to each other.\nAt various instances during the course of cohabiting with a partner who is battling with substance addiction, tolerance to the self-destructive behavior eventually becomes a part of the degenerative or dysfunctional relationship for the sake of peace by the sober half? This inadvertently encourages the addiction by default.\nBecause addiction is indeed a disease that can leave a devastating effect on the people closest to the addict. Without intending or even coming to a self-realization, the unsuspecting or emotionally exhausted partner in a bid to cope with the situation as best as they could without confrontation, the partner would have assumed or played the role of the enabler or as the codependent spouse to the substance abuser. This is a dangerous approach to adopt and It is important to severe this unhealthy role and identify these patterns immediately, in order to arrest the situation before further deterioration.\nOpen a judgment free line of communication. Constantly talk to your partner about everything, the kind of support they need, with a calm and supportive voice, free from confrontation or prejudice. Make them understand this is a safe space. Talk about your dreams, desire and hopes; highlight your expectations and identify goals that are not only relevant to the addiction but other facets of your lives as couples and as individuals. Communication is a two way streak, encourage your partner to share and be forth coming likewise. Don\u2019t be overbearing and if possible do more of the listening.\nAdopt the patient approach \u2013 Patience is the watch word in any relationship, talk more of a dysfunctional relationship that has substance abuse as an issue. Be honest with yourself that there is no quick fix to the situation; it is rather a marathon than a sprint. Take it one step or one day at a time with yourself and your partner. Being consciously aware of this fact will equip you to keep serenity in the seeming midst of chaos.\nAvoid any form of shaming \u2013 One of the major triggers of drug use or relapse in this case is when the addict feels antagonized. Avoid the blame game. It may be difficult, but remember that addiction is a disease, and rightly an affliction of the mind and body, rather than an inability to control oneself. Rather celebrate any level of improvement or progress attained.\nRebuild the burnt bridges \u2013 years of addiction can wreck considerable havoc on the fabrics of any relationship. Trust, love, respect and integrity may have been lost and eroded. This all needs to be reestablished consciously, and it will take an effort by both parties to get back to how things were or even better. Spend time getting to know each other again, and this can only be achieved by doing things together as a couple. Find new hobbies and interests.\nLeave room for mistakes or setback \u2013 it is advisable you are not overtly optimistic, maintain a level of pessimism, this would allow you give room for errors. Even after rehab and therapy, relapse might occur, in such eventuality continue to lend your unwavering support always.\nIt is also worthy to mention that couples therapy is not only confined to addressing the substance abuse problem alone, the underlying root causes of other conflicts that exists in the relationship will also be addressed. Adequate counseling will also be incorporated to the treatment. Because failure to address other unattended issues in their relationship can easily become the trigger that can push the recovering individuals back to drugs.\nAt www.couplesrehabs.org we provide an array of specialized addiction treatment and individual therapy for couples, and you are guaranteed that you will receive the best help attending our rehab facility located in the California area.\nWe understand the complexity that accompanies drug or alcohol addiction, this is why we are networked with different couples substance abuse centers all around the country for your utmost convenience, and to provide the best possible solutions tailored to meet your peculiar needs.\nThis program is specifically designed for either married or unmarried couples who are grappling with the struggles of substance addiction in their relationships respectively.

I thought I'd share my thoughts on the subject, but while I'm at it I'm going to explore how the rules should be changed.\nFirstly I should explain that I am not completely sure what the rules are about who gets paid what and what options a creditor has if he doesn't agree with the 10p (or what ever it is) in the pound that they are owed.\nWhat I do know is that in 2008 a company went into Administration and was subsequently declared bankrupt and it owed my wife over \u00a310,000. The owners and staff had been paying themselves hundreds of thousands of pounds in salaries while the business failed to make money, and even (obviously) spent what turned out to be millions of pounds that it didn't have. I am fully aware of the implications of the 'little man' as the founder of the company that owed us \u00a310k plus went home to his \u00a32m house that was safe as he had a limited company.\nThus I do have sympathy for anyone that is trying to earn a living, look after their family and pay the taxes that provide public services and then get stuffed when mismanagement causes businesses to fold. In the case of Crystal Palace (just like any other company, football or otherwise) I would love to see their Chairman lose his house and the shirt off his back. I read an article recently where Mr Jordan was boasting that he has fifteen cars - he listed them as he was so proud of them. I mean, how can you need 15 cars? He will be allowed to keep them all, of course, and his yacht, which he brags he paid \u00a33m for (it might have been \u00a32m I'm not that sure).\nThe other thing that I feel needs addressing is this condition to repay any football debts. I'm very pleased that we will benefit from the reported \u00a3100k they owe us, but if they are forced to repay all football debts, yet get away with 10p in the \u00a3 to the Inland Revenue this needs to be addressed. The Inland Revenue is, after all, the public purse. This is the money used to pay for hospitals, schools etc.\nWhen I mentioned that my knowledge of the rules was limited I did so with the intention of floating the idea that HMRC should force a football club to repay 100% of the Tax due or go out of business. This would be rather unfair on the club in question, but it would make others think twice about 'cheating' the public out of their money by putting a limited company into administration.\nI remember the fuss when Leeds were in administration. According to Wikipedia, Ken Bates only offered 1p in the pound initially. He eventually paid 8p in the pound. Thus the reported \u00a335m debt was reduced to \u00a32.8m. They owed the Inland Revenue (you and I) \u00a36m. Thus the public purse was shortchanged of \u00a34.92m. Even now the presenters on TalkSport happily tell us that Ken Bates saved Leeds and he's done a great job. He did so by managing to wipe off \u00a332.2m.\nThe former footballers (who's intelligence I question) don't seem to have a problem with the fact that we have nearly \u00a35m less to spend on hospitals where sick children are dying due to a lack of resources. No, not at all, Ken Bates is a real Hero.\nPortsmouth are in a bit of a jam at the moment. There seems to be some confusion about a penalty points deduction in the Premier League. I'm not sure what the actual situation is as there has never been an administration in the Premier League, but I suspect that with debts of \u00a360m (or what ever they are) they would be advised to go into administration before the March deadline, reduce their debts to a few million, knock the Inland Revenue and start in the Championship with little (or no) debt with two seasons of parachute money to get them back up again.\nIn fact, this should be the new model for all promoted teams. If you go up you should borrow c.\u00a360m to spend on players, go into administration, get relegated (there was a fairly good chance of this happening anyway), sell a couple of players and end up with \u00a350m of players and cash in the bank.\nThus I think it is time for a football club to be forced to close it's doors and cease to exist. This is just needed as a lesson to the rest of the footballing world that it is no longer acceptable to spend someone else's money and then pay something like 10% of it and start again.\nFor the record Leeds and Palace are not the only clubs that have benefited from this. Southampton have, from the little information available, managed to build a super stadium for nothing - or a massively reduced price at the very least. Sure they have been deducted 10 points in the third division, but from what I've seen they have the biggest transfer budget outside of the Premier League. How must those that have suffered financial hardship as a consequence of their administration feel when they seem them buying million pound players? Leicester City did the same thing. They built the Walkers Stadium then went into Administration and never paid the full price for it. What made their actions even worse was that they didn't even suffer a 10 point deduction as the rule hadn't been introduced by then.\nNow it is no secret that I don't like Palace, and for me they are the perfect club to make an example of, despite the fact that I suspect they will end up defaulting on less than those others I've mentioned. At the very least HMRC should demand that their debt is treated with the same priority as football debts. Maybe it's time for a change in the law to enforce that across the board.\nI know people are suggesting that we could well be in a similar situation at some point (this summer being mentioned) but even though I don't want Charlton to cease to exist, I believe that these administrations are currently just too beneficial to the football clubs, and are often used as a business practice. The punishment should be so severe that no one relies on it.\nOn a side issue, having looked at our accounts most of the debt is owed to those that run the club. Sure we have a 'mortgage' on The Valley, but as that is secured it is likely to be paid in any event. Thus administration would cost the Board millions. From sporadic reports it looks like the board members wanted some money for the Club and/or (depending on which reports you believe) they wanted their loan bonds to be repaid. If they don't sell the club and it goes into administration they are likely to get a very small percentage of that money. That could well have been a major motivating factor in the \u00a37m injection in the summer. I'm not suggesting that our directors only care for their own money, but I'm guessing that if Simon Jordan was owed \u00a315m by Palace and they owned the ground that was worth many millions, he would have bank rolled the club from his own finances, rather than the money he has 'borrowed' from local businesses and us taxpayers.\nAs it is I suspect that Palace will sell a couple of their players (I'd be amazed if anyone would pay much of a fee for Ambrose - I don't think there are many secrets in football and he underperformed for Newcastle, us and on loan an Ipswich) then survive in the Championship and be no worse off next season.\nSomething has got to change. Imagine if every football club went into administration. We would all have 10 points deducted, and we could write off literally billions of pounds of debt with no real consequences at all for the footballing world. This system actually punishes the sensible, the prudent, and the decent.\nSo, for the record, I hope that Crystal Palace are forced into liquidation and cease to exist. Sure that's personal, why shouldn't I hate them, their fans hate us. However, the main reason for this is that I am sick and tired of seeing millionaires (Chairmen, Players and their Agents) being unaffected by these actions while the tax payer and small businesses lose millions of pounds that they can't spare.\nI have read an reread Dave's post on last night. I agree with all of what he says, but I do feel the need for a moan of my own.\nFirstly can someone tell the manager and/or the players that the introduction of the prices for next year's season tickets is not the time to play the worst football (at home) of the season. I haven't read last night's program yet, but I'm guessing there will be something more about the tickets in it, and this after the prices were published the night we 'scraped' past Hartlepool 2-1.\nA run of eleven unbeaten is, actually, quite fantastic. I know we are in the third division, and we are a big club and all that, but you can only beat those that are in front of you, and we are averaging two points per game. You have to go back to 1986/87 to find a season where the team in second place of the third division (in all it's names) had an average of more than 2 points per game. Since we switched to three points for a win in 1981/82 there has only been that one season where an average of two points per game was not enough to finish in the top two. The last season of two points for a win we were in the old Third Division and we managed 59, but with 3 points for a win we would have managed 84.\nMaybe Norwich and Leeds are going to pick up fewer points in the last 19 and 21 games respectively. Maybe 90 points will be enough to win the division, but either way our side has a better average now than it has finished a season with since I've been watching. Our Football League Championship season we finished with 91 points. I know we fell apart at the end, but after 27 games we had 56 points, we currently have 54. It's not exactly a complete disaster.\nSure, losing at home was a disappointment. I truly believed that after we scored that late equaliser against Swindon we would go the whole season unbeaten at home. Clearly it was not to be, but as Chicago Addick says, there is a lot of football to be played, and many twists and turns to come.\nThe biggest worry, though, is that I actually believe that Parkinson is getting the best out of what he has. We don't have a natural left sided player to play on the wing. Wagstaff has done a good job out there, but to be fair to him he is young, and he is (like most of the squad) right footed. He looked good for a couple of games, and the side looked balanced too, but the Millwall game was too much for him, and I believe that using him sparingly is the best for both the player and the team. Neither Bailey nor Shelvey are left wingers. They have both done a job there, but they both look like central midfielders playing out wide.\nUnless we can do a deal to swap one of our central midfielders for a winger then we have to accept that we are going to be hopelessly one sided. We are going to be easy to predict with Lloyd Sam being the focus of most of our attacks, and our left flank our weakness as the 'winger' in front of Basey (and Youga soon - hopefully) is often wandering into the centre. A note for Grant Basey, he has suffered a lot of criticism recently. Let's try to remember that he is still very young; he has had little or no protection from the player in front of him; he gets forward and creates things, like Mooney's goal last week; he is our reserve left back - in an ideal world he would only play a handful of games in a season. Just how good a reserve left back do we expect to have in the third division?\nSo if Parkinson is getting the most (give or take) out of the players we have, and there is little chance of signing any new players we probably have to accept that Norwich and Leeds are going to prove difficult to catch. This is a depressing thought as we really do need to get out of this division at the first attempt if we have any realistic ambitions of being safe in the Championship if and when we get there. However, the playoffs are still a route to promotion after all.\nMy only moan about last night was that I didn't think the foul on Nicky Bailey was all that bad, and from what I've read elsewhere the TV cameras confirmed as much. I don't mind a player doing what he can to gain an advantage, but to have rolled around on the floor like he'd been shot while Orient scored then running half the length of the pitch to complain about it made Bailey look like an unprofessional spoiled child. It also made him look like a cheat. He has been irreplaceable for us this season, but last night he was positively average (like many of his team mates). It is time for this side of his game to go.\nOn the whole it was a disappointing performance; it was a very disappointing result, but we still have a better than average points per game than has been needed for a top two finish in 29 of the last 30 seasons. If either Norwich or Leeds go on a run of one win in four we could be right back in it. We need to pick ourselves up and go out on Saturday and continue our record breaking season.\nTonight we face a mid table side that took a hammering at home on Saturday. I'm fully expecting that we will come out of the traps on fire and the game will be as good as over after half an hour.\nTo be fair I tend to say that every week and I'm not sure we've actually done that more than once or at best twice this season, but tonight I'm sure we will.\nNormally you don't want to face a team when they have just been hammered at home, but with six defeats in their last nine games this should be a shoe in for three points tonight.\nOf more note is the club's recent offer to freeze prices of season tickets if you renew by 31st March, and to buy a five year ticket at this season's prices too. Both Dave and Blackheath Addick have written about this, and I don't disagree with them, but I also have a different angle to discuss.\nImagine, if you will, those scenes at Turf Moor on Sky Sports last summer with queues of fans waiting to hand over their money to secure a seat for their Premier League campaign. Sure, they wanted to see Man Utd and Arsenal. Sure they wanted to see Blackburn, their derby rivals, but they were in anticipation of the new season because they'd seen so much success. From the end of February (including the playoffs) Burnley won ten, drew three and lost just one game. It's no wonder they were queueing down the road to commit for a whole year.\nCompare that to us. Despite losing only one in our last eight games, our run from the end of February was two wins, six draws and four defeats. What is even worse is that was about our best run of the season. It's no wonder that we had a struggle to sell season tickets last summer. We look good at the moment, and I am still confident that we will be in with a real chance of winning promotion this season, but let's face it we would need to win the league or a playoff final for the fans to feel much more enthusiastic about Charlton than they do right now.\nThus the plan to 'cash in' on our current wave of enthusiasm is great business. Sure it will raise much needed income now, and the five year tickets will be a real shot in the arm for the cash flow, but the real benefit, as I see it, is that it will not in any way, shape or form, reduce the total number of season tickets we ultimately sell. I happen to think it will mean many more sales, personally. Last summer I was tempted to have a year off from watching Charlton. Right now I am happy to commit to next season irrespective of which division we are going to be in.\nSo again, I have reason to praise the club and I feel more confident that things will be alright, and I have a feeling that we are going to record a big win tonight - although I'm sure I've heard that before.\nWell, that turned out ok didn't it?\nIt was nowhere as easy as I'd expected, and had Beavon not missed his early chance the result could well have been rather different. Having said that he did manage (rather more by luck than judgement) to march through our defence without losing the ball.\nAs I've said previously I am not very good at match reports, and my analytical skills seem to be best used at looking for faults rather than praise, even when it's due. Yesterday's game was, for me anyway, the perfect spectacle for an away game.\nDon't get me wrong I love winning games 5-0 (I have seen a few) but coming from behind and winning is always more enjoyable (in this case giving away a lead before scoring a late winner). If we had been ten points ahead of second place and fifteen above third by now I would be more than happy, but it would take a little away from each match as it would seem to be a bit of an irrelevance. Winning three nil, and looking safe after twenty minutes or so is fine, but it's just so much more exciting to enter the last few minutes of the game needing something - be it a goal or to not let one in.\nWe survived the early scares, and Wycombe had a few chances that would, 99 times out of 100, have led to a goal in the games we played as recently 2006/07 (Premier League). I am only just coming to understand the difference between a 'real' chance in this division. Beavon is probably a good professional (I actually have no idea) and maybe his early miss was not very characteristic of him, but Rooney, Owen, Henry et. al. would have buried it. Thus until I really learn the limitations of strikers in this division (including ours, to be fair) we are going to feel like we have had more let-offs.\nAnyway we went on to settle and dominated the rest of the first half getting a great goal by Shelvey, and looking the most likely to score. Wycombe didn't give up, and with better finishing or a bit of luck they could have scored in the first half. Sometimes you need to be only slightly better a side to win by three goals, other times you need to be a much better side to win by one. Yesterday was one of the latter occasions. No disrespect to Wycombe, and the result didn't flatter them, but I still believe as I did on Friday that if we had to play them again, we'd win again.\nThe fact that the game was in doubt until the final whistle added something to the atmosphere. I have only been to a handful of away matches this season but I've sensed a greater atmosphere among the Charlton fans at each successive game. There seems to be a closer relationship with the players too. I was rather critical of Nicky Bailey in the summer. He was (at Championship level) caught in possession of the ball a few times, and that coupled with a press release that suggested he wanted to leave made me feel a little resentment towards him.\nWith his performances this season (and from very early on) my thoughts changed. Granted I expect that he would rather play elsewhere (Premier League for sure) but he has led by example this season. Parkinson's decision to make him Captain looked, initially, like a sweetener to keep him. It might have been some, or all the reason, but he has led by example in the same way that Steven Gerrard and John Terry do. With hindsight, something that I have now and Parkinson didn't have in August, his selection as Captain was inspired. Parkinson's decisions all over the place are looking more and more inspired. My criticism of his appointment in November (and again December) 2008 was for the right reasons, but he has clearly proved to be the right man for us. Next season in the The Championship (should we be promoted) or League One (with players having to be sold) he will have it all to do again, but for now I'm more than happy with him. I think he has done enough to earn our respect and, more importantly, our patience and realistic expectations.\nAnyway, back to yesterday. On the way up to the game my Dad and I were discussing our hopes for new signings (as you do) but we both concluded that even though we are screaming out for a dedicated left winger, assuming we can keep Mooney until the end of the season the priority is to keep what we have. Nicky Bailey being the most influential individual this season (and probably last season too). He was picked out by the fans and his name was sung more than all the others added together - clearly we are not the only Charlton fans that like him. His goal seemed to come from a perseverance and a determination to score/win. It was his run to the fans (not very far to be honest) and the expression on his face that reassured me that he is not looking for a move in this transfer window. That doesn't mean he won't leave, but normally these things are driven by players. He clearly has a bond with Charlton fans. It makes the treatment he received from Barnet fans earlier this season all the more understandable.\nThere is a feeling beginning to resurface that the players are not just footballers playing for our team, they are our players, they are our boys. If nothing else that is something to celebrate.\nWell, we've been hearing about this for a few years now and suddenly the football clubs have got what they wanted.\nIt will be interesting to see just what the mouth pieces of Man Utd, Chelsea and Arsenal will have to say about it when they end up having to play Champions League and Premier League games at the rate of two a week for six weeks.\nThis break has, however, been a bit of a blessing for us. True it would have been better had we not allowed Norwich to play a game when we didn't, but they had to play their game in hand at some point, and if there is any added pressure with being in the top two then let them have it for a few weeks. With both our full backs out with injuries, and with Christian Dailly suffering from some illness it means that we should have a better squad of fit players to pick from when the games are rearranged. Frankly it doesn't matter where we are in the league until the final game is played, so anything that gives us a better chance of winning a game is ok by me.\nIt also reduces the number of games that Norwich can play before the end of January. I have no idea if they are actually going to sell any of their stars this month (one of their Directors says they aren't - but he would say wouldn't he) but on the off chance that they are the more games they can hold over the better as far as I'm concerned.\nI am a little worried about Colchester suddenly. They look like keeping hold of Lisbie, and from what I read they have money to spend. They have been on a great run since October, and with another player or two they could be a real challenge to us.\nThere has been little happening since it started snowing, but we are now a week into January and we don't seem to have made much progress on bringing in any players. Akpo Sodje seems to have gone back to Sheffield Wednesday, Mooney (who I think made a big difference when he came into the first team) has gone back to Reading injured. McLeod looks to be in discussions with Peterborough, but as there is some negotiating to be done I can only assume that they want him on loan for a proportion of his wages until the end of the season and then they can send him back if he turns out to be as good for them and he has been for us.\nOn the subject of injuries, is it only me or do we keep being told that so and so will be out for a few days or a week and then he disappears for weeks on end. Richardson was going to miss a couple of games, and hasn't been fully fit since he failed to finish the game at Gillingham on 24th October. Youga was going to be out for ten days or so, that was on the 24th November.\nI don't know if the club guess (and get it wrong) or they mislead the fans or the opposition, but it is a little frustrating when they get it so wrong - especially when they are players that we need and want to see in the side. No disrespect to Basey or Omozusi, but I'd much rather see Richardson and Youga in the starting eleven.\nWith tickets for Wycombe already bought I hope that we get to play that one, but I guess the weather will decide that - something else that rarely seems to go as we are promised by the 'experts'.\nI love Christmas. I really do love it and I always have done. I'm a kid you see. I know most women think that most (if not all) men are children, but I am a proper example of someone that has managed to keep the mental age of a ten year old despite being 38.\nChristmas is just so exciting. Santa Clause comes with sacks full of presents, there is more drink to consume than normal, and we play rather a lot of games in a short space of time.\nThis year, not unlike last, I have had the added bonus of having a son to get excited with. Mrs KHA has been completely bewildered by our repetitive declarations that \"I'm so excited\".\nThere was added excitement with Christmas this year as I am on taking and bringing home from school duty. This means that I am responsible for looking after my 5 year old Son from when the school breaks up. Thus my Christmas break started on the 18th December.\nSo, Millwall was in my Christmas 'holiday'. I've now managed to calm down from the disappointment of letting in that late equaliser, and can see that the game was a classic, and as much as I wanted to win, I accept that on the basis that they had ten men for so much of the game they probably deserved a point.\nI love going to football on Boxing day. Away is ok, but I like to be at home. Again we failed to win, but the last few minutes were as exciting as I can remember at The Valley. In fact, now that I do think about it the last time I remember a game finishing so excitingly was when we beat Blackburn with a late goal in December 2006. I was convinced that El Karkouri was going to hit it like a rocket, and hit the wall, but he bent it 'round the wall and The Valley was ecstatic. It is rare to score late goals that mean something, and a draw with nine men is as exciting as a win - it certainly was on Boxing Day.\nStill, that result left Norwich and Colchester breathing down our necks and another game in two days after playing our socks off with nine men, and with two influential players missing. The Brentford game was always going to be difficult, not only because of what we'd been through, and the players we had missing, but they have been very strong at home - having not lost there for almost three months (including Leeds). Thus a 1-1 was acceptable in the circumstances.\nThe fact is, the circumstances shouldn't have arisen. Sam Sodje was a fool to lunge into that tackle. I believe he was sent off for us on boxing day two years earlier for a two footed challenge. Totally unprofessional, and was in large part responsible for the four points that we could have had if we'd won those two games. Dion Burton also let himself and the team down with his sending off. I do have some sympathy with him as he was technically correct that the Referee had allowed all sorts of fouls to go unpunished on Akpo Sodje. To have remonstrated so much was probably always going to end up with a booking. The hand ball, however, was just plain irresponsible. It is my belief that he did it to make a point that he was being fouled. I can understand why he did it, and might have done the same thing myself. I should point out that I am a spoilt, bad loser, and I would probably have made a big dramatic statement about being man handled by the defender. I am not, however, a professional footballer. Burton should have known that with all the fuss with Thierry Henry's goal against the Irish there was going to be a punishment for it.\nOn reflection, despite having a very bad game, the referee had little choice with Sodje's red card or Burton's two yellows. Sadly it probably cost us four points (at least two) and that could well mean everything if we fail to finish top two and don't win the playoffs. I don't want to be too dramatic, and there is a lot of football left to play, but it is quite possible that our football club could well be in real trouble in the summer if we fail to win promotion, and I doubt that we will finish more than four points behind the team in second place. Still, if we could afford a central defender that never put a foot wrong we wouldn't be in the division in the first place. I think I would be inclined to release Sodje in the summer though. With such a limited squad you can't carry liabilities, and he has been sent off 14 times in his career now. He has missed five games, through suspension, for us this season, and we have half the season to go. Anyway this is a discussion for another time, and I may well have changed my mind by the summer.\nWalsall was a bit of a disaster. Not only did we slip out of the top two for the first time this season but I drove to my Dad's and we were 25 miles from the ground when the game was called off. Strangely we discussed not going. I think in these situations (when a pitch inspection cannot guarantee the game will go ahead when the away fans need to leave) a full refund should be offered those that decide not to travel on the off chance that it goes ahead. I feel sorry for Walsall, but to have two games called off with less than two and a half hours before kick-off does give the impression that they were gambling the fans travel costs in the hope that the game would go ahead and they would get more money or would get money quicker.\nI will not be going to the rearranged game, but the whole episode has probably cost us over \u00a350 and best part of a whole day in the car. I left my home at 9:30 and got home at 5:30.\nAnyway we have an average of exactly 2 points per game, the same as Norwich, and it's all to play for. Their recent form has been outstanding, but we have been amazing at times ourselves this season. The only ray of hope is that Norwich are rumoured to be in financial trouble and with the transfer window working the way it does they will need to sell this month or they will not be able to raise any more funds until the summer. This could (and, in fact, would) be a great gamble if they really do need the money. I'm not all that familiar with their situation, but I do remember them selling something like 17,000 season tickets in January last year. Thus their match by match income must be rather low. Anyway time will tell, and even if they don't sell we could still finish above them. They do need to come to The Valley, after all.\nI also think that Leeds could be catchable. I know they look like they are out of sight, but the sale of a star or two could cause a lack of confidence that could do to them what the sale of Andy Reid did to us two years ago.\nSo we start the new year (and decade) with an average of two points per game, goal difference behind a team that needs to come to our place, and with suggestions that we will be strengthening our squad while they will be selling to raise money.", "version": "v0"}

Fifty years ago. All the way back in 1947 Carl Barks wrote and drew a story called \"Christmas on Bear Mountain\" in Donald Duck comics. Dell Comics actually published it in \"Donald Duck #178\". It marked the first appearance of Scrooge McDuck of the Scottish clan of McDucks. He didn't have all the familiar personality quirks that we would come to love, but the core idea was there.\nThe story follows Donald, broke and unable to buy any gifts for his family. He gets a surprise invitation to his Uncle Scrooge's mansion way up on Bear Mountain. Scrooge has sent for his nephew so that he can test his character. He plans on scaring Donald by dressing up as a bear. But nothing in life happens as planned and a baby bear wanders into the living room while they're out and falls asleep beside the warm hearth of the fire place. Hilarity ensues and through a series of unintended consequences Scrooge believes that Donald has past his test and comes the next day to have Christmas with them.\nCarl Barks never intended on using the character for other than that one issue, but he soon realized the fun he could have with ole' Scrooge McDuck and the rest is history.\nIf you get a chance to find a copy of Donald Duck # 178, don't hesitate. It's a great story with wonderfully rendered Barks artwork. If you've ever read any of Don Rosa's work you'll notice he pays tribute to Barks tales, particularly \"Bear Mountain\" in his enormously entertaining stories.\nSo as you gather round to celebrate the holidays this week, remember that another thing we have to be thankful for is that rich, old Scrooge McDuck and the three cubic acres of wealth in his Money Bin. He looks pretty good for fifty, doesn't he?\nScrooge is my favorite of the original Disney gang too (I like him much more than Mickey).\nMy favorite Disney character is Donald, but as far as the comics go, it's Uncle Scrooge, unquestionably.\nWas watching CNN while stuck in an airport in Brussels last week and they showed a poll for the best known fictional billionaire and Scrooge was number 1! This was an international poll I am assuming since it was playing in Brussels but isn't it just amazing how much influence this character has had.\nHow many other \"fictional\" billionaires are there?\nHaha Honor - I usually make the same distinction. Donald is my favorite overall, Scrooge is my favorite in the world of the comics.\nAs to Scrooge being the #1 billionaire in Brussels, remember that the duck books are much bigger in Europe than they are here.\nInteresting note about Scrooge - he is voiced by the same actor who played Wilbur Post on the old tv series Mr Ed!\nThe actor is Alan Young. Had the previlege to meet him briefly in 1999. Very friendly person.\nHe played Scrooge in \"Mickey's Christmas Carol\" as well as \"Ducktales\".", "version": "v0"}

Lung cancer is the leading cancer killer of both men and women in the US, and up to 20 percent of people who die from it have never smoked at all.\nWhy might a nonsmoker get lung cancer? Exposure to radon (an odorless gas found in homes) is often to blame, explains Robert McKenna, Jr., MD, a thoracic surgeon at Providence Saint John\u2019s Health Center in Santa Monica, California. Other possible culpritsinclude air pollution, secondhand smoke, and environmental hazards like asbestos.\nWhether you smoke regularly or have never lit up in your life, keep an eye out for the following symptoms. Although there are plenty of less nefarious reasons why these issues might crop up, play it safe and discuss them with your doctor.\n\u201cThe majority of people with lung cancer have a cough, occasionally with blood,\u201d says Dr. McKenna. Bringing up thick, rust-colored mucus can also be an early sign. But even if you have a dry cough, if it\u2019s lingered for over a month, it\u2019s worth getting checked out.\nMost of the time, viruses are to blame for lung infections like chronic bronchitis. But if you\u2019re repeatedly getting sick and every illness seems to go straight to your chest, it could be a sign of cancer, according to the American Cancer Society.\nIf a lung tumor begins pressing against your superior vena cava (the large vein that carries blood from your head and arms to your heart), you may notice swelling in your neck and face, says Dr. Jacoub. Your arms and upper chest can also be affected.\n\u201cThis is different than feeling tired,\u201d Dr. Jacoub notes. \u201cIt\u2019s feeling so worn out that you can\u2019t wait to climb into bed,\u201d and getting lots of rest doesn\u2019t help. As many as 80 percent of people with cancer note \u201cexcessive tiredness\u201d as a symptom.\nLung cancer affects your muscles as well as your organs. One of the first areas to be impacted: your hips. \u201cYou might find it hard to even get out of a chair,\u201d says Dr. Jacoub. Weakness in the shoulders, arms, and legs is also typical.\nCertain lung cancers make hormone-like substances that upset the balance of minerals in your body. In some instances, says Dr. McKenna, excess calcium gets released into the bloodstream. While you may not realize your levels are through the roof until your doctor orders a lab test, you should notice the symptoms that go along with high calcium: frequent urination, excessive thirst, constipation, nausea, belly pain, and dizziness.", "version": "v0"}

The gift of 5 pounds of figs from an organic farm was a thrill. These had to be made into the best jam I could concoct \u2014 better than I\u2019d ever made in years past.\nThinking of places where figs grow in common abundance, even wild out of rock crevasses, this is my recipe for the best fig jam I\u2019ve ever tasted. The reduced sugar allows the flavor of the figs to shine through and adding orange and vanilla enhances the flavor of figs.\nNote on alternative ingredients: If you didn\u2019t make candied peels last winter, substitute just the zest of a large orange, stripped off with a potato peeler. If you don\u2019t have vanilla beans, substitute a tablespoon of real vanilla extract.\n1. Measure the sugar into the work bowl of your food processor. Add in the orange peel and process until the peel is tiny specks. Doing this also pulverizes the sugar to \u201csuper fine\u201d so it dissolves more easily.\n2. Put the sugar back into the measuring cup and put the figs into the processor and pulse until the figs are nicely chopped with still some larger pieces. Do this about a third at a time. Don\u2019t crowd them and don\u2019t process too long \u2014 you do not want a puree, just chopped. As they\u2019re done, pour the figs into your jam pot. Then pour the sugar over the top.\n3. Give the mixture a quick stir, then leave it while you get out jars, your water bath pot, and equipment. Make sure your jars are impeccably clean with no chips. Fill the water bath with hot water and put it on to heat.\n4. The fig mixture will be juicing out and the sugar starting to dissolve. Give it a more thorough stir and let it sit again. It takes at least 1 hour for the mixture to be syrupy with no dry sugar showing.\n5. If you\u2019re using a vanilla bean, put that into the figs now and put the pot over medium heat. Stir frequently, the mixture is thick and could scorch if not attended. Bring the jam to a slow boil, turn down the heat and let it simmer, still stirring frequently.\n6. Now dip your jars and equipment, ladle and funnel, and put the jars upside down on a clean towel next to the stove.\n7. Continue to cook the jam, stirring for about 15 minutes. It will be very thick, easily coating the spoon. Scrape down the sides of the pot back into the jam. When the jam looks very translucent and shiny, it\u2019s ready.\n8. Remove the vanilla bean or add the vanilla extract. Turn off the heat and ladle the jam into jars. Seal and process in the boiling water bath for 10 minutes. Remove to a towel leaving space between the jars to cool. Allow the jars of jam plenty of time to cool and \u201cping\u201d, then label (including the year), and store in a dark place.\n9, Rinse the vanilla bean and replace it in a bottle with a little vodka or brandy \u2014 you can use it a few times.", "version": "v0"}

Allowing the audience a chance to catch its breath, Costello slowed things down with Still Too Soon To Know, bringing complete silence to the park.\nA particularly outstanding moment during the show came when the audience was treated to a seamless transition from Alison into Smokey Robinson's Tracks Of My Tears. It was a sweet reminder of Costello's earlier influences.\nIt was evident that Costello, bassist Bruce Thomas, drummer Pete Thomas and keyboardist Steve Nieve invested hours of rehearsal to get their sound just right. So right that if you closed your eyes, it was hard to tell if you were sitting at home listening to your CD player or it you were at a concert listening to a live performance.\nThe awe-struck audience remained in its seats for most of the show, until standing ovations turned the park into a mass dance floor during the three encores.\nCostello's performance during his three encores went beyond audience expectations and followed an exhibition of non-stop energy for the first hour and 45 minutes of the show.\nCostello seemed a little tired during his first encore, but he must have caught his second wind as the band returned, exuding pure volume for a second and third set.\nThe level of stamina and excitement rose as Costello plunged into his third encore, playing four songs one after another and ending with Pump It Up, a track from the album, Girls, Girls, Girls.\nFor die-hard Elvis Costello fans, an added feature of the show was the reunion of long-time friends and fellow musicians The Attractions.\nFor die-hard fans, The Attractions' presence on stage did not go unnoticed, considering the show demonstrated pure professionalism.\nTo say Costello just put on another good show would be an understatement.

Public hospitals (especially those that in the past obtained 501(c)(3) letters from the IRS) and public universities need to carefully look at whether they are covered by this new reporting and excise tax requirement.\nWhat is the reporting/excise tax payment due date and what IRS forms must be used?\nAnswer: If your entity owes this new excise tax, the due date for payment and filing is the 15th day of the fifth month after the end of your entity\u2019s taxable year that ended in 2018. (Filing is only required if you owe the tax.) For example, in the case of a 2018 calendar year taxable year, the due date will be May 15, 2019, and, for a July 1 through June 30 taxable year, the due date will be November 15, 2019. This is the same filing date as used for your Form 990 if your entity files that form. IRS Form 4720 should be used to report this new excise tax liability and its payment. You will also need to answer \u201cyes\u201d to question 15 in Part V of Form 990 if your entity files that form. You can request and receive an automatic six-month extension for the Form 4720 due date by filing IRS Form 8868 no later than the initial Form 4720 due date. However, the excise tax remains payable on the initial due date and, if you wait to pay until the extended Form 4720 filing due date, your entity will owe late payment interest and penalties.\nWhich of your employees can trigger the excise tax?\nAnswer: Any current or former employee who is one of your entity\u2019s five highest compensated employees in any calendar year after December 31, 2016. Compensation for this purpose is generally Form W-2 Box 1 earnings provided to the employee by your entity or a related entity (based on a greater than 50 percent control of governing directors or ownership interest) with respect to the employee\u2019s employment by that related entity. [Note: Compensation for this purpose will include certain items that vest in a year but will not show up in Form W-2 Box 1 until a later year; e.g., bonuses that vest in one year and are paid out within 2 1/2 months of the following year and certain severance promises.] Compensation paid to a licensed medical professional (such as a doctor, nurse, or veterinarian) for the direct performance of medical services does not count. For example, if the doctor spends 25 percent of her time treating patients and 75 percent of her time acting as a medical director or manager, then only 25 percent of her compensation will be excluded from consideration for purposes of this analysis. These top five compensated individuals are known as \u201ccovered employees\u201d under the new rules. Once a person has been designated as a \u201ccovered employee\u201d for a year, he retains that status for the rest of his employment with your entity. Although the standards are not exactly the same, in any given year you should expect to find your top five \u201ccovered employees\u201d among the \u201cOfficers, Key Employees and Highly Compensated Employees\u201d listed in Part VII \u00a7A of your entity\u2019s Form 990 if it files one. Once you have designated your \u201ccovered employees\u201d for 2017 and 2018, start keeping a running list that you add to each year.\nUnder what circumstances will your entity owe this new excise tax?\nAnswer: Your entity will owe this new excise tax for its taxable year beginning in 2018 if (i) the compensation (as defined in Q&A 3 above) paid to a \u201ccovered employee\u201d in the 2018 calendar year exceeds $1 million, or (ii) payments are made in 2018 to a \u201ccovered employee\u201d under an involuntary separation severance package that had, on the date the \u201ccovered employee\u201d involuntarily separated from employment, a present value equal to more than three times the \u201ccovered employee\u2019s\u201d average compensation for the five calendar years preceding the \u201ccovered employee\u2019s\u201d involuntary separation from employment (\u201cexcess severance package\u201d). Compensation paid or vested during the calendar year ending within your entity\u2019s taxable year is treated as having been paid in that taxable year.\nHow is this new excise tax calculated?\nAnswer: For compensation over $1 million paid to a \u201ccovered employee\u201d in a taxable year, the excise tax is the amount of the \u201ccovered employee\u2019s\u201d compensation over $1 million multiplied by the corporate tax rate under Code \u00a711 (currently this is 21 percent). For payments made during your entity\u2019s taxable year under an \u201cexcess severance package,\u201d the excise tax is the Code \u00a711 corporate tax rate multiplied by the portion of the \u201ccovered employee\u2019s\u201d severance payment that exceeds the amount of the \u201ccovered employee\u2019s\u201d average annual compensation allocated to them under a rather complicated formula developed by the IRS. In the end, after the entire excess severance package has been distributed, you will have paid the excise tax on an amount equal to the present value of the excess severance package reduced by one year of your average annual compensation.\nWhat is the effective date for this new excise tax and reporting obligation?\nThis new rule is fairly complicated and this article is not an exhaustive treatise on the subject, but rather is designed to give you just enough information to \u201cissue spot\u201d and decide if you might be subject to this excise tax and need to file a form 4720 for your entity\u2019s taxable year starting in 2018. If, after reading this article, you think that your entity might have an issue, you should investigate the matter in more detail. The statutory source of this new requirement is Internal Revenue Code \u00a74960 and the IRS has issued a helpful 92-page explanation of its take on the new law. (See IRS Notice 2019-09 \u201cInterim Guidance Under \u00a74960.\u201d) If you do not want to wade through this material yourself, then you should consult with your legal or tax advisors.

Owens who put him in jail for an allegation of contempt.\nHis own attorney at that time, Trumbull resident Daniel Portanova failed to show for that 2009 hearing. Opposing counsel, Stanley Goldstein, lied and misrepresented other facts before Judge Owens.\n\u201cEven after Owens found and stated on the record his concerns that my former wife had taken it upon herself to change the court orders and that he couldn\u2019t find me in contempt, he ultimately acquiesced to Goldstein\u2019s demands and ordered that I be immediately incarcerated,\u201d Lynch explained.\nHe said that Connecticut employees later allowed Goldstein to resign from the bar, despite pending disciplinary actions being prosecuted by the state from a litany of Fairfield County complaints.\n\u201cThere were several people after him for doing the same thing he did to me \u2014 falsify records, making knowingly false statements, producing fake exhibits,\u201d Lynch said of the attorney who represented his wife in the case.\nGoldstein, whose practice was based in Trumbull and was a longtime Monroe resident, had been on an earlier one-year disciplinary probation ordered by the same court in Bridgeport. He resigned in 2012 in the midst of four grievance complaints that were being prosecuted by the state\u2019s Office of Chief Disciplinary Counsel. His resignation was accepted by Bridgeport\u2019s Presiding Civil Judge, Barbara N. Bellis, even though Goldstein was not present to attest to the authenticy of the letter or be questioned about its contents.\nJust one day before the end of the legislative session, the Senate voted unanimously on consent (36\u20130) to vacate an earlier dismissal of claims brought by the 54-year-old Trumbull resident against the state of Connecticut in 2013.\nThe original claim, filed by Lynch with the Office of the Claims Commissioner, was dismissed by former Commissioner J. Paul Vance Jr. in 2015. Lynch then sought review of that dismissal by the General Assembly as provided for by Connecticut General Statute 4-159.\nThe matter was first reviewed at public hearing by the Judiciary Committee, which later voted 38\u20137 in favor of reversal.\nUpon passage in committee, the matter then advanced to the House of Representatives, where it passed 109\u201333, with nine members absent and not voting.\nRep. William Tong (D-Stamford), chairman of the committee, noted that Lynch\u2019s testimony was compelling.\n\u201cHe has suffered a great deal over the past few years \u2026 and we think [his] claims and his story merit further examination and \u2026 we think there\u2019s an important public purpose in doing so,\u201d he said.\nTong publicly praised the longtime Trumbull resident for his respectful approach and sincerity while proposing reforms to the judicial system.\n\u201cI, for one, appreciate Mr. Lynch\u2019s approach on issues that are difficult and emotional and thank him for his consideration,\u201d noted Tong on March 30, 2016, just moments before the Judiciary Committee voted overwhelmingly in support of reversal.\nSen. John A. Kissel (R-7th District) added similar supporting remarks, as did Rep. Minnie Gonzalez (D-Hartford).\n\u201cThis has been a terribly difficult and life-changing ordeal,\u201d Lynch acknowledged.\nPrior to his 2009 divorce, which was overturned on appeal, he said had no prior experience with the law or the United States legal system, but is now an outspoken advocate for much-needed reform.\nAmong the most important aspects of the General Assembly\u2019s decision to vacate the claims commissioner\u2019s dismissal, Lynch will now be able to pursue his claims without facing a defense of sovereign immunity, which often protects the state or state actors.\nLynch, who served as a volunteer soccer and lacrosse coach in town, is an award-winning author and internationally recognized genealogist and lecturer, having volunteered his services at both the Trumbull and Bridgeport libraries on many occasions.\nHe said his only other court appearances before the divorce were for speeding tickets. He never imagined when he and his wife set out to separate that it would result in a decade of loss, as well as time behind bars.\nIt\u2019s been a long, brutal road for the Trumbull resident, but he believes the end is in sight with the most recent hurdle cleared.\n\u201cTo this day, I don\u2019t know why the judge looked the other way, but I\u2019m intent on exposing this informal network of judges and attorneys and making sure it doesn\u2019t happen to anyone else because it has cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars and it has brought my business to its knees,\u201d he told The Times. \u201cIt has impacted my physical and mental health; it destroyed my life in every facet.", "version": "v0"}

Lioconvoy has a harsh, career-military side to him, but also has a humane gentleness. There are times when he behaves as if he knows something about the secrets of the planet where the battle is taking place.\nRobot Mode: The first thing one notices about Lio Convoy is his rather assymetrical upper body design. With most Transformers figures that transform into four-legged beasts, the beast head either forms the chest or ends up in place of one of the hands. Not so with Lio Convoy. The lion head of his beast mode becomes his right shoulder. And while this isn't very practical for him, as it gives him a huge blind spot on his right, it looks very, very impressive.\nSpeaking of impressive, Lio Convoy's entire look certainly is. The white, red, and golden color scheme looks great on him and his body is very lean, very detailed, and very posable. I especially like his chest design, which somewhat mirrors the classic Optimus chest, but gives it its own spin and doesn't disturb the lean, streamlined look of the body at all. The panel on the chest's left side can open up, showing Lio Convoy's sculpted Matrix.\nThe one little thing that I don't like about this robot mode is, that his shoulder arrangement is a bit unstable. The shoulders, which are basically the back of the lion from head to tail, just sit loosely on top of the torso. Raising his arms too high causes the shoulders to 'rise', to the point where his head is almost completely obscured. It would have been better if the shoulder section would click solidly into place, even if that meant his arm movement would be more restricted. It's not a big thing, but it means you need to be a bit careful when posing the figure.\nLio Convoy has weaponry in abundance. Each forearm features a flip-out missile launcher, as well as a double-bladed claw that flips out from the beast mode paws hanging underneath the arms. Two additional missile launchers are hidden in the lion's mane on his right shoulder. These can detach and be used as hand guns. Lio can also use his missiles as clubs, as they fit nicely into his fist holes. And finally the lion's mane on his shoulder can be made to spin like a buzz saw, which would probably have lethal effects in close quarter combat. Sadly I'm missing all but one missile for Lio Convoy's four missile launchers, but he's certainly not lacking any firepower.\nSo all in all Lio Convoy's robot mode is pretty great. Some minor design changes might have made him even better and one shouldn't think about how he might deal with attackers appraoching from his right side, but other than that: Very cool. Possibly the best-looking robot of the Japanese Beast Era.\nAlternate Mode: Neither his name nor his look in robot mode leave much of a doubt into what kind of beast Lio Convoy transforms. He becomes a white lion with a golden mane and tail. When he's just standing there, the lion looks very impressive. The head appears to be a tad bit too large, but just might just be because of the big mane, which covers almost the entire front half of the body. Some robot parts are visible on its belly and the robot's joints can be seen a bit on the rear legs, but these are easily ignored.\nWhat's not so easily ignored is the lion's lack of posability. Not in the rear legs, these are fully posable thanks to double knee joints and posable ankles. But the front body is pretty much a statue. The head is immobile and the front legs only consist of the 'forelegs', so to speak. The 'upper legs', which would be somewhat hidden by the mane in a real lion, simply aren't there. The forelegs can move on ball joints, but pretty much any pose that's not simply standing looks more or less unnatural due to the lack of an upper leg. The claws from the forlegs can unfold here just as they can in robot mode, of course, but don't really look all that great due to the fact that they emerge from the bottom of the paws. Ligerjack pulled off the claw gimmick quite a bit better than Lio Convoy.\nThe lion has an attack mode of sorts, as he can flip out all four missile launchers from the mane, making for an impressively armed beast. Still, even this very nicely done attack mode can't disguise the fact that Lio Convoy's beast mode is more for looking at than playing with. It's not a bad beast mode, mind you, but the thing with the front legs pulls it down quite a bit.\nRemarks: After the first season of the Beast Wars ended, Japanese producers decided to bridge the gap between seasons with their own Beast Wars series, called Beast Wars II. The storyline closely mirrors that of the original series, leaving two opposing groups of Transformers stranded on a strange, primitive planet where the good guys assume beast forms for disguise purposes. The leader of the Maximal group is Lio Convoy.\nAs a figure Lio Convoy pairs a spectacular-looking robot mode with some minor design problems with a beast mode that is more for looking at than anything else, but pulls that part off quite well. I actually acquired the Robotmasters version of this figure first, which, despite its much smaller size, managed to fix some of the design problems this larger version suffers from. The lion mode still doesn't have proper forelegs there, either, though. Anyway, this figure here has some quirks, but overall I like it very much.\nThis 'standard' version of Lio Convoy is actually less common (at least on ebay) than the transparent 'Flash' version. A third version of Lio Convoy was available in black (a black repaint? Oh, those wacky folks at Takara always come up with something new, don't they?). Whichever version, if you can get your hands on one and are a fan of either Beast Transformers or Primes/Convoys, then you should definitely grab it. It's probably not for everyone, but me, I like it a lot, so despite the shortcomics of the beast mode it gets a very good (if somewhat subjective) rating from me.", "version": "v0"}

Being comfortable and taking the time to relax is important for both physical and mental health.\nBut, if you've ever looked at our FSA eligibility list, you've probably noticed an absence of things like massages, yoga classes, meditation retreats, and other things that can enhance your well-being. This is because the IRS has strict guidelines about what is considered a qualified medical expense, and comfort and relaxation currently don't fit into those standards.\nWhy aren't they qualified expenses?\nAccording to the IRS, for an expense to be eligible the item or service needs to be for the diagnosis, treatment, mitigation or prevention of a disease or condition. Items and services that you purchase solely for your comfort and relaxation generally don't fit into any of these categories. So while they might be necessary for your overall comfort, they aren't considered a medical necessity.\nThe good news is that you can still use your FSA funds to help achieve comfort and relaxation, as long as that comfort comes from treating a specific medical need.\nAcupressure Mats: In this writer's eyes, all discussions of FSA-eligible pain relief start here. Acupressure mats are an excellent way to relieve muscle discomfort, and many people find them to be the perfect remedy for back pain after a long day of sitting in an office chair.\nWhen used regularly, they can even help improve circulation and flexibility. They're eligible for reimbursement with your FSA and can be used just about anywhere you have room to lay down.\nAcupuncture Therapy: This centuries-old technique is popular amongst people who suffer from chronic pain and discomfort. The acupuncture technician uses thin needles to target precise points on your body which will ease the pain. In addition to muscular pain, many people use this technique to find relief from frequent migraines.\nAnd acupuncture therapy is generally considered FSA-eligible without a prescription. In some cases, administrators may require a Letter of Medical Necessity (LMN) to substantiate the expense, so check with yours before making that appointment.\nHeating Pads: Heating pads are a popular and simple way to ease pain and provide comfort. Applying heat can help ease muscle pain, menstrual cramps, ear aches, and headaches. These pads are FSA-eligible and come in a variety of styles and sizes.\nFoot Circulators: Not a month goes by where someone from our writing team sings the praises of these foot circulators. And once you try one, there's a good chance you'll do the same thing.\nIf you spend a lot of time on your feet, you've probably experienced tired, aching feet on a regular basis. Foot circulators help relieve this discomfort with electrical stimulation. This eases pain, improves circulation, and helps minimize swollen ankles and legs. These circulators are FSA-eligible and can make staying on your feet all day considerably more comfortable.\nSo, what's the takeaway here? While you can't turn to your FSA exclusively for comfort and relaxation purposes, it doesn't mean you won't enjoy those benefits while treating your specific medical needs. Because, after struggling with some serious aches and pains over the years, there's nothing more relaxing than treating and relieving it with the products mentioned above.\nFrom FSA basics to the most specific account details, in our weekly Asked and Answered column, our team gets to the bottom of your most-pressing flex spending questions.

This very thin mirror is one of the five main mirrors of the ELT\u2019s optical system, with the main segmented mirror being 39 metres in diameter.\nSafran Reosc are manufacturing all six of the deformable shell mirrors that comprise the M4 mirror.

Installers no longer have to contend with wide, L-shaped brackets that prevent complete access to mounting clamp fasteners.\nThe new L-Foot does not cover the top-mounted bolt on the AceClamp ML or impede access to the AceClamp A2 side bolt, making any adjustment or re-torquing quick and easy. The bracket\u2019s shorter foot allows complete access to the clamp\u2019s grounding cable channel, so the bracket doesn\u2019t have to be removed to install the grounding wire.\nThe FM-Approved AceClamp ML is a standing seam metal roof (SSMR) clamp system that can accommodate almost any application or roof seam profile. It is UL 2703 compliant. Its two-piece design allows installation at any point on the seam with one of the tightest vibration tested grips in the industry. The single fastening screw is top-loaded, providing easy, quick access for the contractor, completing installation in less than half the time of conventional side-mounting systems.\nThe AceClamp A2 is one of the strongest clamps tested, compared with single set-screw clamps, in the SSMR market. It is UL 467 and 2703 compliant. Its unique design virtually eliminates the need for periodically re-torquing clamps. The A2\u2019s innovative solution prevents torque back-out by employing a distinctive \u201cpush-pin\u201d design that locks two stainless steel pins onto the roof panel to secure the clamp. The A2 also saves time and money where grounding cables are used, as the clamp is designed with a grounding cable groove incorporated into the clamp itself. A stainless steel sleeve and set-screw kit securely hold the grounding wire in place. For the installer, this feature eliminates the need for a separate grounding attachment. Like the AceClamp ML, the A2 does not penetrate or scratch the roof\u2019s surface, preserving manufacturers\u2019 warranties.\nAceClamp/PMC Industries has received authorization to apply the UL Mark to its AceClamp non-penetrating, standing-seam metal roof fasteners and solar kits. This stamp of approval indicates a product has passed stringent testing for code requirements and performance.\nThe AceClamp A2 and Solar Kit and AceCamp ML and Solar Kit were tested for Mechanical Loading and Bonding Evaluation in accordance with UL 2703. The AceClamp A2 and Solar Kit was also evaluated to UL 467 for its integral ground-lug function.\nUL 2703 covers rack mounting systems, mounting grounding/bonding components, and clamping/retention devices for specific flat-plate photovoltaic modules and panels. UL 467 applies to grounding and bonding equipment in accordance with national electrical codes.\nTo meet UL 2703 requirements, mounting and clamping devices are submitted to rigorous testing methods to confirm the products will withstand most any environment and maintain electrical conductivity.", "version": "v0"}

As the operations differ, so do the strategies for controlling costs. From a financial perspective, a data centre needs a huge capital outlay for the building, extra capital spending for software licenses and servers, and smaller but essential operating expenses for powering the cooling systems and the servers, and for management and maintenance. In the cloud, on the other hand, you will not incur any capital expenses. Instead, there can be enormous operating costs, charged for the server virtual machine requests, software licenses, network traffic, and other minor details.\nCloud Inventory Visibility: Lack of visibility in cloud resources can result in poor management of the resources involved. Effective management starts with a detailed analysis of the entire infrastructure. If some cloud resources are going unused without your awareness, but your company is paying for them, the costs will escalate gratuitously and cut into your infrastructure savings as well as other financial benefits brought about by cloud. To have complete visibility of the cloud services used, you should analyse the usage trends and patterns first. Irrespective of your cloud environment, as well as tracking the resources you have spent, it's significant to predict what you'll be using. You will need granular and consolidated details to correlate data analysis and reports against business objectives.\nBudgets: Define and assign budgets for all departments, projects, cost centres, and also ensure approval structures to prevent cost overrun by sending alerts when the set thresholds get breached. Use Show-back reports to chargeback your departments for their usage of cloud resources, limit the expenses and the use of resources.\nRole Based Access: Allow the users to manage the infrastructure actively after setting up a business-wide mechanism that plainly defines accessibility and permissions within the platform. You can limit the data as well as actions visible to the users by roles and organisations. Also identify who terminated, changed, or launched infrastructure, and the steps they took to control costs.", "version": "v0"}

This is especially problematic for refugees arriving without official documentation such as a completed transcript, diploma or other proof. A World Education Services (WES) pilot in Canada has tested an \u201calternative assessment\u201d methodology using available evidence of educational attainment and professional achievements when these official documents cannot be obtained. WES is a non-profit organization that evaluates and advocates for the recognition of international education qualifications.\nAs Canada has resettled more Syrian refugees, local institutions and employers voiced concern that these refugees, many of whom are highly-educated, would not have access to recognized credential documents for pursuing higher education or regulated professions in the future.\n\u201cBecause Syria had a highly-literate population and a well-functioning education system before the war, we knew many of these refugees would be highly educated, proficient in English or French and determined to resume professional careers or pursue further study. Recognition of previous education in Syria, therefore, would become a priority for these individuals, since it is critical to this goal,\u201d shared Denise Jillions, Associate Director of WES Global Talent Bridge, during a recent webinar about the pilot project.\nWES started exploring the degree of support among academic institutions and regulatory bodies for an alternative assessment model allowing for use of non-verifiable or incomplete documents, in contrast to their standard strict document policy. They decided to move forward in testing a new service delivery model among Syrian refugees in Canada to determine the validity and potential utility of alternative assessments. WES received 337 applications for the pilot program between July 2016 and May 2017, and they were able to prepare Alternative Credential Assessments for applicants who submitted at least one piece of documentary evidence.\n78% of refugee participants surveyed after the project indicated that the Alternative Credential Assessment will be useful in taking next steps toward their education and/or career goals. About 20% of those surveyed who already have plans for using the assessment indicated they would like to pursue a new profession, with the majority of respondents reporting they would like to use their assessment to pursue higher education, return to their original profession or find a similar position suited to their level of experience and education.\nAbout 73% of end-users, including academic institutions and employers, reported confidence in the alternative methodology for assessing credentials.

When we were announcing brand new SK titles from the UK publisher, we'd just barely get enough orders to keep the price reasonable for the UK slipcase. We don't want to charge a \"crazy\" amount for a slipcase, you know? I'm sure some collectors wouldn't mind the higher prices and would understand how production costs work (less volume = higher cost to us that has to be passed along in the form the retail price), but a lot of the more \"casual\" SK fans lose their minds over the pricing and it becomes a hassle for Mindy.\nSo doing slipcases for the older UK titles probably wouldn't generate enough orders to keep things reasonable, unfortunately.

Sure, by no means a bad effort, but not exactly something to reinvigorate people\u2019s trust in darkwave revivalism. And to say that Luis Vasquez\u2019s musicianship has changed or become a gold standard of quality will also be somewhat foolish. But what it can be commended for is that it stayed true to itself, releasing solid projects one after another with maybe only the most recent one, Deeper, delving into even more industrial and electronic depths. That gave me hope that maybe we will eventually see some level of evolution and self-reinvention. So I am happy to report that Criminal really isn\u2019t a rehash of the same old story, but I am also sad to admit that it is a change for the unpleasant.\nFor one, Luis added a little more range to his vocals, which he only did every so often before. And together with the renewed and more danceable sound, they sound more frantic and distressed. Also, talking about the sound, it is miles denser and harshly technical than before. At times it even reminds more of an IDM record than a post-punk one.\nAnd here we come to the biggest problem of the record. See, it\u2019s not that it is directionless (it does hold up the dissonant insanity of a style it chose for itself fairly well), it is that the strange, morphed beatdown electro-punk route it takes just too often seems rather off-putting. The once prevalent darkwave roots still do shine through the magma of beats and harshness, but the said harshness still does prevail.\nOn paper, Criminal is a perfectly okay album with a little more jarring edge to it than one would expect or desire. But upon listening to it and revisiting it, it evokes less and less enthusiasm with each new track and each new spin. The fundamentally unpleasant production and the inherently dismal atmosphere could be technically defined as a typical trait of a proper post-punk record. But even the most brooding post-punk act has a sense of melody and hidden beauty to it. Criminal has shrilling instrumentation and forgettable tunes. It is no longer a \u201cSoft Moon\u201d, now it is the exact opposite, a bloody piercing sun.\nAlbum's alright, but just that.\nWill I get to a 100th review before butcherboy?\nAlmost certain we're gonna agree on this one Universe.\nThe sort of industrial-strength (geddit) post apocalyptic cheese that Trent Reznor is terrified of producing in 2018...but maybe he should stop being such a big girl's blouse and release something as visceral as this?\nBad news: the instrumental sections are nearly always better than the vocal segments, and the instrumental itself is the best track.\nI\u2019ll call it great cause it\u2019s pretty rough. Little too edgy for me to really enjoy fully but maybe if I clear my mind I can let go of my bias a bit.", "version": "v0"}

A central server maintains the file-integrity database and configuration for a client and at a specified time, sends the configuration file over to the client, runs a scan and sends the results back to the server to compare any changes. Those changes are then sent via email, if configured, to a system admin or group of people. The communication is all done over an encrypted communication channel.\nIt should be noted that the central server or the server maintaining the management console should be kept secure and limited access allowed to the server except for those administering the osiris management console and the clients that will need to communicate with it. By default, the management console will only allow incoming login connections from the localhost (127.0.0.1) and any other hosts will need to be added. Those allowed access to the management console can log onto the server directly or log in remotely with the osiris commandline client, provided their IP is allowed to connect. If the central server is kept secure and a client is compromised and the attacker deletes or kills the osiris client, no problem. The central server maintains the configuration file and the database. All that needs to be done is for the client reinstalled on the compromised system, preferrably with a static binary as this article describes, then the admin logins into the management console, pushes a scan config file over, initiates a scan and it will send the results back and compare it against the database on the central server, so you can still see what the attacker did on the computer.\nThis article discusses how to mass deploy Osiris in a Linux environment. This is useful for environments with a large number of computer systems they want to deploy Osiris too. This applies if Osiris is going to be installed and managed locally or 2,000 miles from where the managment console is located. The mass deployment is done using the program \"remote_update.pl\". It uses SSH to execute commands on multiple machines and logs the output to a file for each system it logs into. It has the ability to only run commands on servers that failed during a previous run. Also, multiple machines can be logged into at once. Since remote_update.pl requires a password that is located in a text file, the program \"ccrypt\" will be used to encrypt the text file and decrypted on the fly when remote_update.pl is executed. There are other programs that can be used such as GnuPG but ccrypt was chosen because it too is portable across many Operating systms Linux, Solaris, AIX, BSD's, Windows, etc. and can be quickly deployed.\nUntar the distributions to \"/tmp/\".\nThis will prevent the \"remote_update.pl\" program from prompting you for input when Osiris is installed on the remote systems. Change any other options you need in that file.\nIf you will be running Osiris on multiple Linux versions, you can compile it as a static binary on one Linux system and then push that binary out to the other Linux systems. If you want to do this, then add this before running ./configure: export CFLAGS=\"-static $CFLAGS\"\nCopy the files that you want to transfer to the directory \"files/\"\nThen, create a script that will untar the Osiris distribution and run the install program on the remote systems and put that script in \"scripts/\".\nNow comes the really imporant part, the \"password\" file. The remote_update program comes with a sample password file so you can peruse that for more information.\n# 1. Be sure no one is looking over you shoulder during this part!\n# 2. Be sure you type the passwords correctly.\n# has to be one tab over and underneath the username for that particular user.\nAfter you type a password to encrypt the file it will give the file a \".cpt\" extension.\nHere is what is going on. First you decrypt the contents of the \"password.cpt\" file (/usr/bin/ccat password.cpt) and pipe it into the remote_update program and tell it to get the password from standard input: (| /usr/sbin/remote_update.pl -p - ) then specify the directory where the scripts and files to copy over is located (-d /tmp/osiris). I have a sick and personal thing about seeing stuff moving on my terminals so I specified the verbose switch (-v). For each host specified in the hosts file under \"/tmp/osiris\" there will be a \".log\" file created with the verbose output from the remote system under the \"/tmp/osiris/\" directory. This is the same output as the (-v) switch on the commandline. If there are any errors with installing osiris on some hosts you can specify the (-f) switch and remote_update will only retry the hosts that failed.\nUnder the directory \"/tmp/osiris\" there will be a \".log\" file for each hosts specified in the \"hosts\" file.\nNow you have three great programs to work with, Osiris, remote_update.pl, and ccrypt. Remote_update.pl can be used for a wide variety of purposes when you are administering a lot of computer systems at once.\nDuane Dunston received his B.A. and M.S. degrees from Pfeiffer University and he has his GSEC certification from SANS.

It is an initiative of the Social and Resource Development Fund (SARD) under the supervision of the Kashag and Department of Finance.\nOn 2 September 2008, the incumbent 13th Kashag laid down policy vision for the empowerment of Tibetan women in the diaspora. SARD has been initiating a series of programmes including trainings, discussions, workshops and counsellings to educate and encourage Tibetan women to take more proactive role at various administrative levels.\nIn his keynote address to the participants, Kalon Tripa Prof Samdong Rinpoche said since the beginning of human civilization in Tibet, Tibetans in their entire history have not experienced problems such as gender inequality or gender oppression and exploitation. Particularly since the spread of Buddhism in Tibet, the importance of gender equality explained in Buddhist teachings have flourished in Tibet, and continue to do so even to this day, he added.\nKalon Tripa stressed that the \u201ccore objective of the women empowerment programme is not to demand rights for the women, but to invoke and activate the inherent power of womanhood\u201d.\n\u201cThe idea of Tibetan women empowerment is provide equal opportunity to women so that they do not lack behind in taking up their share of universal responsibility,\u201d Kalon Tripa said.\nKalon Tripa presented the proportion of male and female participation in the Central Tibetan Administration and in various regional level institutions.\nThe total number of official civil servants is 464 out of which the male and female ratio is 309/155. Out of total of more than 700 staff working in Tibetan settlement offices in India and Nepal, the ratio is 446/274. The strength of women in the governing bodies of cooperative societies is low which is only 25 against 229 men. The figure is also at the low of 16 against 190 in Rawang Denpai Legul Tsokchung. Out of 206 local leaders (gyapon) only 24 are women.\nKalon Tripa said emphasis must be laid on efforts to increase the number of Tibetan women's participation in the Tibetan parliament, local Tibetan assemblies, board of directors of cooperative societies, Rawang Denpai Legul Tsokchung and local leadership in Tibetan settlements in India, Nepal and Bhutan.\nHe emphasised that there should be some tangible increase in the number of Tibetan women participation in these institutions within a span of next 10 years.\nA group of panelists, including Dr Juile Thekkudan of Society for Participatory Research in Asia, Ms Dolkar Wangmo, counselor at the department of education and Ms Tenzin Dhardon Sharling, research and media officer at the Tibetan Women's Association, will preside over a panel discussion.\nKasur Jetsun Pema, Kasur Rinchen Khando and Mr Jampel Choesang, Chief Election Commissioner and Chairman of Public Service Commission were present at the inaugural session.", "version": "v0"}

The load zone has always provided a host of issues that concern those who work on conveyor belts. These concerns will often include, impact, belt wear, and sealing. Together, these issues make the load zone the most expensive and problematic section of the conveyor.\nPerhaps most readily apparent is the problem of material spillage. The fact is, spillage clean-up is often one of the greatest cost factors in the use of conveyor belts. Hauled product can fall from high speed belts, escape from transfer areas during loading, or stick to the belt as carryback that can be deposited down the belt line.\nAny spilled material is wasted material, whether it has to go through process again or is simply factored as a loss. In addition, any displaced material can also shorten the life of components. When material becomes trapped between the belt and idlers, for example, it can lead to idler failures as well as damage to the belt carcass.\nEscaping material not only requires extra clean up personnel but can also cause significant issues in regard to safety. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) in the U.S. sets the regulatory limits on dust and debris in the mining environment and it is imperative that new conveyor systems and transfer or load zones meet these types of requirements \u2013 or similar ones \u2013 in many countries. The MSHA studies have concluded that conveyors with a greater degree of spillage also have the greatest number of accidents. Prevention of spillage and successful sealing are non-negotiables at productive mines.\nImpact and belt wear can be just as problematic in the loading area and must not be overlooked. Material impact or other jagged materials have the potential to penetrate and rip the belt, delivering belt stopping damage to the cover and carcass. Loading materials can often nick or cut the belt. Frequent heavy loads can weaken the belt carcass. Because of this, an investment in belt protection can be the difference between a moving belt and a stopped one and a productive mine does not have the option of unnecessary downtime.\nThough often easy to identify, the issues concerning spillage, sealing, and belt wear require viable solutions and numerous attempts have been made over the years to tackle these expensive and time-consuming issues; all with varying degrees of success.\nTaking a step back and looking at the overall conveyor design is one place to start. New design methods for loading areas focus on designs that control the material flow and diminish the percentage of belt sag, two of the major factors in loading area inefficiencies. These methods are aimed at reducing the common problems experienced in the vulnerable loading and transfer zones. Controlling material flow and achieving zero per cent belt sag attempt to halt the problems before they occur.\nEveryone can benefit when these new types of design technologies are implemented, in that it will lead to the creation of more efficient work areas. In the majority of applications, however, the conveyor system is already in place or a company will find that the innovative design alone will not solve the problem as effectively as required. Because of this, additional methods are needed in order to control the safety, housekeeping, and cost issues associated with material flow and material containment.\nOther attempts to improve the load zone have included using some kind of metal, urethane, or other type of skirting to try to seal the area. Impact idlers are also often used \u2013 as are slider beds \u2013 to deal with material impact. The Conveyor Equipment Manufacturer\u2019s Association (CEMA) recommends that some type of impact absorbing protection is used in loading areas, such as impact idlers, impact beds, or cradles.\nA truly effective solution will resolve both the impact issues and containment problem simultaneously.\nMines around the world that have found success in their load zones share a few commonalities and Richwood, a thirty-year veteran of the mining industry as a developer of conveyor accessories, recommends following three basic fundamentals for optimal load zones.\nStraight line, consistent belting elevation support under skirtboards.\nInternal wear liner installation for maximum containment of bulk material load.\nThe use of a high-quality skirting rubber for dust seal outside of skirtboards at conveyor transfers.\nIn Richwood\u2019s experience, these fundamentals have proven to be real world solutions even in the most severe applications.\nWorn metal skirtboard \u2013 Before.\nA recent example of this comes from the northern United States where a mine had been using internal steel wear liners \u2013 many of which were installed several inches above the belt \u2013 with a hard urethane skirting material attached to the outside. Though the steel wear liners had been lowered in a couple of areas, there was still a clearance gap between the liners and belt which placed an overload demand on skirting material to contain the product. Additionally, conventional impact idlers were in use under the belt load zone and there were two kinds of bar type impact beds that were reinforced and repaired on several occasions, yet still were not holding up to demands of the application. As a result, the belt was regularly punctured and damaged by the severe impact and material would often get caught in the gap between the skirting and belt, creating premature belt wear.\nIn this instance, Richwood recommended a system that would stand up to the heavy-duty requirements of the location, providing a reliable and long-term solution.\nThis meant starting with Step One; Creating a consistent straight line of belt support. In order to accomplish this, patented Richwood Impact Saddle was required. When choosing the right type of impact protection for a transfer point, CEMA recommends calculating for the force of the \u2018impact from a single lump\u2026 as the criterion for selecting the duty rating of an impact bed.\u2019 The Impact Saddle fits the bill as it exceeds CEMA ratings for impact and is in a completely different category from both idlers or slider beds. The Richwood Impact Saddles are not considered idlers because they do not use rolling cans and they are not typical slider beds because the Impact Saddle cradles the belt to provide full belt support.\nIdeally suited for impact areas, Richwood Impact Saddles are built to control the impact energy by three mechanisms: distribution, isolation, and absorption. When the material falls, its force is spread to a Ultra High Molecular Weight (UHMW) saddle segment, where it floats on a rubber cushion that is molded to a steel frame. Not only do Impact Saddles protect the belt from impact, they also become an important partner in a reliable Material Containment System and create a belt free of sag, which is a precursor to successful sealing. Richwood Impact Saddles are built as a direct replacement for any standard idler and are designed in any idler profile. When butted together, Impact Saddles provide a continuous impact bed and the full belt support provides the ideal skirt seal. The continuous curve does not have any gaps in the cradle, but provides complete trough support. For this particular application, it was recommended that a series of Impact Saddles be placed under the transfer point on 12-inch centers to create a solid UHMW-Polyethelene (UHMWPE) impact surface.\nOnce the foundation was laid with a straight line of elevation, the next step was to add Richwood Canoe Liners to the inside wall. Richwood Canoe Liners use a specially formulated rubber (with optional ceramic matrix) to deal with the problem of abrasion from passing material, as well as providing impact protection and containment of fines and material. Canoe Liners are unique in that they reliably handle abrasion and sealing while being easy to work with. In contrast to most liners, Richwood Canoe Liners come in standard sizes that are easy to install, with a bolt-on feature and manageable sizes. Richwood liners can be furnished up to four inches thick as required by the application and custom sizes are also available. For the northern U.S.A. application, 14\u201d x 1 \u00bd\u201d liners were recommended to replace the one inch steel and the Canoe Liners used were ceramic with ceramic bevel, where the beveled edge helped to assure best sealing with the belt.\nLastly, for a complete Material Containment System, Combi-Clamp \u00aeSkirt Clamps and Rock Flex \u00aeSkirt Rubber were added. RockFlex is a proprietary rubber blend that is long lasting yet self-sacrificing so that the conveyor belt is not in danger of being grooved or worn by the skirting. By using RockFlex\u2019s specially formulated rubber skirting, the area was safely sealed while belt cover damage was eliminated. To partner with the skirt rubber, Richwood Skirt Clamps were recommended and were specified for their long wear life and ease of use. When adjustment of rubber is required, the clamps will allow for easy release and repositioning of the skirt rubber as needed.\nThere are no special tools required to install or move the skirt rubber. Simply lift the clamp handle, place and clamp down again. This simple system keeps product and debris where it belongs, off the floor and on the belt.\nAn alternative option that is available, but not specified for this application, is the complete material containment system called the Loading Station Tailpiece, or LST. The LST is available as a complete, stand alone, prefabricated system that contains Impact Saddles, Clamps and Skirting, and built in support structure.\nAt the northern U.S. mine, all of the recommendations were implemented and, as a result of these changes to the loading areas, the mine has experienced worry free load zones with no more clean up under loading areas and no more problems with belt punctures, demonstrating that prevention the best form of maintenance. The right philosophy of containment and impact protection, combined with the correct application of equipment help to keep hard working mines running both profitably and efficiently.", "version": "v0"}

There were also several months of hearings that have included debate on the broader agribusiness economy, rural development, infrastructure, farm credits, subsidies, NAFTA, cotton, and food stamp programs.\nOne bill to cover all of these challenges, many of which were exacerbated by Washington in the first place.\nForgive our skepticism over Washington\u2019s ability to fix so many problems in the agricultural sector.\nToday, we want to address the real problem in today\u2019s agricultural industry.\nIf Rep. Michael Conaway (R-Texas) is still listening\u2026 please, let us help solve a problem that has been a major theme of the listening sessions your committees have observed.\nThree weeks ago, Tony Dreibus at Successful Farming Online stated that many farmers are counting on the new farm bill and the renegotiation of NAFTA to help bolster the economic health of rural America.\nThe stories from the fields are heartbreaking.\n\u201cWade Cowan, the chairman of the American Soybean Association, said now is a tough time for farmers. Low crop prices along with high input costs are making it difficult to make money. When producers don\u2019t spend, everybody in rural America suffers,\u201d Dreibus wrote.\nWe\u2019ve heard stories from across the Corn Belt to the northern Plains. From fruit farms in the southeastern part of the U.S. to the spring wheat fields of Washington State. Crop quality has been declining, local prices remain weak, and balance sheets are underwater.\nThere is a sense of powerlessness when one reads about farmers fretting about the state of their farms.\nFor example, in 2016, 30 % of Minnesota farmers lost money. And while last month\u2019s AgBarometer from Purdue University and CME Group indicated some increase in optimism, there are still way too many farmers in 2017 who are losing sleep about their grain sales.\nThe idea that Washington is going to be able to solve all of these problems is unrealistic.\nI have two concerns about the agricultural sector.\nFirst, the entire industry is completely reliant on Washington D.C. to make decisions and drive markets. Talk to farmers in Illinois and Indiana, and they\u2019ll tell you that the numbers coming out of the USDA this year appear way out of line with reality.\nThis is part of a broader problem with the USDA, an institution that is built on good intentions but plagued with bureaucracy. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to this industry.\nThe same goes for the Farm Bill, which will attempt to be one-size fits all solution to addressing problems that have emerged in the last five years, but isn\u2019t forward-thinking enough to recognize the challenges we will face in the next decade.\nThe second concern, however, is more important. If farmers are going to earn more for their grain \u2013 and improve the finances of their operations \u2013 then the current wheel must be broken.\nThe agricultural sector must be opened up to promote greater price competition and no longer leave farmers beholden to the status quo.\nInstead of making farmers reliant on Washington, perhaps it is time to find new ways to empower them like never before.\nAfter all of the listening tours and trips between rural America and the Washington, we hope that Ag Chairman Conaway understands that the solution isn\u2019t just more reactionary public policy.\nInstead, it is time to incorporate more local competition for pricing that gives sellers collective power in the market.\nFarmLead is an online grain marketplace that makes it easier to sell your grain in one place and remove many of the hassles that you face on a day-to-day basis.\nWe have proven that sellers can earn more for their grain by bringing more buyers to the market and creating competition at the local levels.\nFarmers no longer have to be on the phone calling around to elevators, digging through USDA basis reports, or digging through local cash bids.\nThey can post your grain and specifications to the online marketplace in just minutes. Doing so gives them access to thousands of buyers across the platform in literally dozens of commodity categories. Whether it\u2019s convention corn or feed wheat or non-GMO soybeans, they can negotiate it on FarmLead.\nAll of our buyers have been financially vetted. One hundred percent of our deals have been completed, and farmers walk away with an average of 5% to 6% more for their grain than other bids they\u2019re getting.\nBest of all: It\u2019s free to post their grain online.\nThis is the only service I can think of that is free for farmers to use and make more money without having to purchase a new tractor or the latest piece of agricultural technology. (Once a sale is completed, farmers do pay a small connection fee that is usually less than 1 cent per bushel.\nFarmLead is part of a broader mission from other agricultural technology companies that aim to empower farmers and help them address inefficiencies in today\u2019s industry.\nRemember, with FarmLead, you don\u2019t pay anything to upfront. Either find a better price for your grain or you pay nothing.\nTo learn more, visit us at FarmLead.com.", "version": "v0"}

You have to do a lot to lose your dog\u2019s love.\nHumans are a little more selective. It takes nice words, a few trying experiences, and a long time for us to learn to love.

Their protective instincts transform them from kind and harmless pups into snarling security guards when danger shows its ugly face.\nAmongst men, that loyalty is often only found amongst immediate family members, close friends, and military personnel.\nAs said before, once you have the unconditional love of a pup, you\u2019ll never lose it. Dogs forgive for major hurts in an instant, whereas humans will sometimes take decades to do the same for minor infractions.\nHow much more fulfilled could our lives be when we remove the pain of rejection and loneliness from our hearts and let love take its place?\nThe difference between dogs and their owners is that the dogs live true to themselves. Mankind hasn\u2019t quite figured that one out. We\u2019re often too protective of our hearts to let someone take our full love, loyalty, and forgiveness.

I was trying to soak up all of the information about Scottish Women\u2019s Hospitals which might be useful prior to our meeting. Of course I had great help from Slavica Popovic Filipovic who wrote on the subject in For Courage and Humanity and other numerous papers and articles. It was her who communicated Alan\u2019s initiative to me and the news that he was coming to Nis with his crew. I was delighted with the project and the idea to meet the people keen on revoking the memory of great women who went far away, into the unknown, to practise humanity at times of war.\nThe crew was very friendly and talkative, eager to get started and arrive at the old military cemetery of the British Commonwealth located at the outskirts of Nis. The keeper of the cemetery welcomed us and gave some insight into the story. It was obvious from his manner of speech that he was pleased with the sudden visitors and the fact that neither Serbia, nor their homeland, has forgotten these women.\nThere they were, among soldiers, six Scottish nurses who gave their lives during the First World War trying to help the Serbian soldiers who fought against Germany and Austria-Hungary. The silent tombstones could not say much, but Alan did. This endeavour was not considered as a task which needed to be accomplished, but he showed strong personal involvement. He approached each one of the graves with grave respect and placed the red roses as if he wanted to revive not only their personal stories but the women themselves. I wonder whether such courage and humanity can be induced today or was that something which belonged to the past. This made me think about the turbulent world history, true values and great people. A person is a collection of memories, stories and deeds of ancestors and until we truly get to know our history we can never improve our future.\nFollowing and listening to these women\u2019s stories, their backgrounds and actions made me unaware of the rest of the crew who were preparing to take photos and film the visit. I never though their professionalism would reach nightfall, nonetheless their smiles could be seen.\nAfterwards, the talk went on in one of the modern parts of the city centre but still with an air of history. A bit tired but satisfied, in good company, we had a few laughs. The people are people with common life stories when stripped of formalities. This was a refreshing notion for our modern commodity occupied minds. I hope the film and the story about SWH will inspire people \u2026just to be people.", "version": "v0"}

Because this attaches in the middle of the device, it allows smartphone photographers to continue using most accessories, even something like Holga's Lens and Filter Wheel.\nHowever, while the GripTight has the benefit of being able to be attached to any tripod, the MPod Mini Stand is permanently attached to a mini tripod. But that's not necessarily a bad thing, featuring flexible leg joints it can be used on most surfaces or even wrapped around objects. It measures 11.6 cm (4.6 inch) tall and weighs 30 g (1.1 oz), making it small and light enough to carry with you most of the time.\nJoby has also released the GPod Mini Magnetic tripod, which is designed for point-and-shoots or action video cameras like the GoPro and features a standard tripod thread. As its name suggests, and like its bigger brothers, the GPod Mini Magnetic has magnetic feet meaning it can securely attach to all sorts of metal objects whether that's a speeding car or a more sedate railing. It also boasts an adjustable neck allowing users to better angle their mounted camera.\nBoth the Joby MPod Mini Stand and the Joby GPod Mini Magnetic are available for a price of US$14.95.", "version": "v0"}

The former may be more popular due largely to its compatibility when it comes to color-matching, yet both colors are timeless formal colors suitable for men\u2019s business wear. But if you already have too many greys in your wardrobe, it\u2019s time to include navy blue in your suit collection.\nIt deserves to be talked about and included in every gentleman\u2019s wardrobe for its youthful and vibrant color which can complement not just the young, but the older professionals as well. Novice suit collectors should always include not just the subdued grey but the navy blue color as well.\nNavy should be characterized differently from most blue colors. The real navy blue colored suit has a depth of color similar to a midnight blue. Navy blue is more versatile as it can be worn everywhere, even black tie optional events. Simply pair it with a formal tie and white dress shirt. However its formality doesn\u2019t end there. A navy blue jacket can be worn in a casual setting as well. By pairing the jacket with a light-colored trouser, you can turn your formal attire into casual wear.\nIt should be noted that the suit loses its formality with the prevalence of patterns in it, but a subtle addition of pinstripes in the mix should still be acceptable in the business world. The navy blue pinstripe is even considered a power suit perfect for business professionals.\nSo if you\u2019re planning to get a suit in navy blue, opt for a solid and unbroken navy color to look more versatile, something you can use for formal business meetings or a laid back weekend get together with friends and colleagues.\nA suit in navy color is characterized by having a rich hue and often made in pure wool fabric and should work well without too much luster. If the weave becomes too smooth, it can appear too slick and shiny which can appear too garish and artificial. A navy suit made in thick wool is a great choice due to its matte texture that gives off its real color. A lightweight wool is a comfortable fabric that\u2019s perfect for summer or warmer climate and keeps the natural draping of the fabric. For as softer fabric, wool is blended with cashmere or another lightweight fabric as wool.\nSynthetic fibers in small quantities are allowed to be added in the weave. The US gives at least three percent of artificial fiber blended to the fabric to allow for some resistance or stretch to the fabric. Too much of the artificial fiber in the weave can make the fabric appear cheap and less durable.\nThe navy blue suit\u2019s fit can make or break its look. And like any other suit, its fit is no exception. It should fit well since the dark color tends to highlight the suit\u2019s flaws. A suit 2 sizes too big for the wearer can make it look baggy. A fitted navy blue suit is tapered close to the wearer\u2019s body thus avoiding any bunching.\nKey points of the suit include the shoulder area, the jacket\u2019s sides, and the length between the trouser\u2019s crotch area and waistband. The key points should be measured precisely to avoid any excess fabric which may appear baggy when too loose thus making the wearer feel uncomfortable. The disadvantage of purchasing in retail stores with a mass produced suit is that it may not be available in different sizes thus it may not be appropriate for all men.\nThe style and detailing of the suit should work well with the wearer\u2019s lifestyle. If you rarely wear a suit yet you need one that can go with all formal events you may be attending, a 2- or 3-button, single-breasted solid navy jacket is a must.\nFor business professionals who wear suits on a regular basis, variety is key. You can add variety to your suit by changing the lapels into a peak style and adding back vents to the jacket to allow the wearer a bit of movement. Have it custom made into a navy double- breasted suit for added style.\nDark colored trousers should sit well around the real waist of the wearer rather than below the hips. Adding suspenders may help the trousers drape well rather than using an ill-fitting belt to keep it in place. For a man with a bigger midsection, a pleated front trouser allows him more room, a plain front trouser meanwhile allows a slimmer silhouette on a thinner gentleman.\nFor a balance, matching a navy suit with other colors and patterns requires careful thought. Blue stands out when paired with a color opposite in its place in the color wheel. Lighter colors work well against its deep hue and white, the most formal color match, would be an easy pick.\nA solid navy suit works well with any other suits and ties with patterns. But a pinstripe should be worn with caution and can only work well with subtle patterns or patterns that are smaller in scale.\nThe navy blue suit remains classic as well as a functional addition in menswear. It sits side by side with charcoal grey as bearers of formalwear\u2019s highest standard. The navy suit is a clear choice for men who prefer a touch of elegance and youthfulness with its attractive color. Every stylish gentleman should own at least one navy suit to complete his wardrobe.", "version": "v0"}

Over time, harsh weather elements can really take their toll. The good new is, you can make your garage door look new again with a fresh coat of paint. It\u2019s a simple, inexpensive fix, but it can easily be bungled. So, below you\u2019ll find some tips to re-paint your garage door.\nWhen planning your garage painting project, it\u2019s crucial to choose a day when the weather will be dry and the family won\u2019t be busy. For the paint to dry properly, you\u2019ll need mild temperatures, no rain, and the ability to leave the garage door closed and untouched for at least 24 hours. Start early so you can get through it all before running out of daylight.\nThis is probably the messiest part. But, if you want this new coat of paint to last you\u2019ll need to prepare the surface well. Start by sanding off the layer of paint that\u2019s peeling or chipping. If you have a metal door, inspect it for rust and sand that off as well. Any exposed metal should be sealed or primed to protect it from rusting again.\nBefore you paint your door it must be spotless. So, get out your pressure washer (use a low setting) or your sponge, soap, and elbow grease. As you wash away all the dust and grime, pay special attention to the bottom part of the door since this is where so much of the dirt builds up. Make sure to thoroughly rinse away any detergent residue and let your door dry completely before moving to the next step.\nIt\u2019s always tempting to get to the fun part right away, but if you take a few minutes to prepare, the cleanup and finished product will be much more appealing. Protect your siding and trim by applying some painters tape around your door. Then, slip some plastic, cardboard, or a tarp under the door to protect your driveway and garage floor from spray, drips, and spills.\nFirst, if you\u2019re painting over a dark color you\u2019re going to need a coat of primer. Make sure the paint and primer you use is made for outdoor use. We recommend latex-based paint products as they tend to hold up best. Apply the paint in thin layers and let each coat dry before starting the next. Use a roller or sprayer for overall coverage and a small brush for edges and details.\nThen, remember not to open your garage for 24 hours after painting to allow for a flawless finish.\nIf your garage door needs more than a facelift, contact Ponderosa today for a repair or replacement!

I found the nearest Starbucks, took a baby-wipe-and-sink bath, brushed my teeth, changed into fresh clothes, and ordered oatmeal and coffee. Now, clean and comfortable, I\u2019ll tell the story of my last two days on the road.\nAfter enjoying my cold beers and a little rest at Lochsa Lodge in the early evening following my Wendover Ridge Hike in the Bitterroot Mountains on Tuesday, July 18th, I drove to Butte, Montana, where I found a cheap but perfectly acceptable motor inn which had, most importantly of all, a bathtub. The hot bath finished the restoration that dipping my arms, head, legs, and feet in the Lochsa River had begun, and I awoke the next morning ready for a long day.\nThe limestone and minerals that make up most of the Caverns are colored in shades of white and gray highlighted here and there with shades of yellow and pale rust. The Paradise Room, the lowest, largest, and most colorful cave in the system, is richly hued mostly in shades of pink and purple. The lighting is carefully designed to show the colors as they would appear in daylight.\nIn the first of the caves, we noticed that most of the small stalactites and some of the smaller stalagmites were broken. This mangling of this natural wonder occurred in the late 1800\u2019s and early 1900\u2019s, when the Caverns were managed and shown to tourists by private entrepreneurs, who charged high prices and allowed visitors to break off pieces as souvenirs of their visits. This is yet one more of the hundreds of examples to show how important the national and state great public parks are. Unfortunately, profit motives and human psychology very often result in short-sighted decisions that cause long term harm, and the tragedy of the commons is revealed in the way some individuals rob the wider community of the opportunity to enjoy the riches nature has to offer unless the people unite to protect, defend, and steward them. Government, in this case as in many others, does provide an invaluable check and balance to the self-centeredness and destructiveness that form parts (but only parts) of human nature.\nSo I\u2019m with documentarian Ken Burns in his belief that the National Park System (and by extension, every state and regional park system) is America\u2019s best idea. Yellowstone, Niagara Falls, Yosemite, the Grand Canyon, Virginia\u2019s Natural Bridge, and countless others of the most awesome, most beautiful, and most rare of the landscapes built by the forces of nature, were despoiled and marred by humans seeking to profit off these wonders regardless of whether their efforts served to protect or destroy them in the long term. Much of the damage is still being repaired if it can be at all, and some of the damage is ongoing and still unresolved as in the case of the great Yosemite Valley in my own California, where heavy car traffic is causing pollution, overcrowding, and wildlife destruction. Even good government fails sometimes, so the public needs to act as a check and balance on that as well. I would recommend that we demand that the National Park System close off Yosemite Valley to private car traffic.\nEarly Wednesday evening, I arrived at Yellowstone National Park, the first national park in the world (way to go, America!) and explored many of its wonders, stopping along the way to inquire at every campsite I passed whether a site had opened up. At long last, late in the evening, one did, a tiny RV site where pitching a tent is not permitted. So, I slept in the car. I felt better about that anyway, since as I was about to pull in to park, I watched a tall, thin man in a black shirt and a long black pleated glossy skirt walking slowly and deliberately backwards through my site, like a scene out of David Lynch\u2019s Twin Peaks. I\u2019m pretty broad-minded in my opinions of human behavior since I consider the variety and creativity in the human species among the most interesting and often delightful of natural phenomena, but this was a little weird. I let him do his thing undisturbed.\nI watched Old Faithful erupt for several minutes just after sunset.\nView of the Lower Falls from the side of the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone. I didn\u2019t get any successful pictures of the osprey\u2019s nest on a tower of rock near the cliff side, where the mother was guarding and feeding her two young. It was a beautiful sight to see her swoop gracefully through the air and quickly return with wiggling prey. A nature videographer on the overlook kindly let me get a few good views of the action through his camera.\nRoosevelt Arch at the north gate of Yellowstone; I was here last this January and the backdrop was white with snow where it\u2019s now green.\nSee the animals dotting the side of Mt Washburn? I saw so much wildlife up here: elk, horned mountain sheep with their young, birds, and chipmunks.\nFrom the base of Mt Washburn, I readied myself for the drive of undetermined length from Yellowstone, Hwy 212 towards I-90 en route to my next destination via Cooke City-Silver Gate. When I was in Yellowstone in January, I saw a lot of buffalo but hadn\u2019t seen any at all this trip. But as I drove in the dark, my headlights picked up a dark shape off to the side with two glowing eyes. I stopped and put on my hazard lights as a fuzzy, light brown, charmingly ungainly creature appeared, followed by a mother buffalo and two more calves. Over the next fifteen minutes or so, I watched a small herd of buffalo wander onto the road then mill around. Two young males found this a perfect place to tussle and push. Bison social hour was finally ended as an impatient motorist finally decided to clear the road by driving slowly at the herd, honking, until they took fright and scampered off the road. A little further on, I came across another car, pointing in the other direction, with its hazard lights on and its bumper caved in. The driver ruefully confirmed that he had collided with one of the herd, but the stricken animal was nowhere to be seen. Buffalo are hardy creatures, I hope that one recovers from the impact. Later on, my headlights picked up elk, two waddling fat little creatures (marmots?), and a red fox. As you may imagine, I drove particularly slowly after all that.\nI drove on, winding up and up and up, until I reached that roadblock I told you about. I gazed at the bright, bright stars awhile, then curled up to sleep.\nThis entry was posted in Traveling Philosophy / History of Ideas, Written by Amy Cools and tagged Beartooth Highway, Beartooth Pass, Buffalo, Caverns, Custer Gallatin National Forest, Elk, Lewis and Clark, Montana, Mt Washburn, National Park, Shoshone National Forest, Tragedy of the Commons, Wildflowers, Yellowstone.

We won the FTC Robocall Challenge in 2013 and launched our service based on Twilio\u2019s platform that same year. Since then, we have built award winning phone security solutions for home phone users, mobile solutions for Android and iOS, and enterprise solutions for call centers, telecoms, and OEMs.\nEven better is the network effect of Nomorobo. Every new user and phone line that we protect helps us spot robocallers even faster. Every minute of every day, our algorithms monitor millions of calls to spot and intercept bad actors before they have a chance to inflict harm on our users.\nThat said, robocalls continue to be a problem that plagues consumers and businesses alike for one simple reason: They work. With only a minimal investment required, scammers need just a few victims in order to be wildly profitable. It is a complex problem that requires involvement by all of the stakeholders in the communications ecosystem, such as telecommunications carriers, public policy officials, and other vendors that enable communications.\nAnd while robocalls will be a thing of the past someday, we at Nomorobo feel that more can be done immediately to protect Americans from illegal, unwanted robocalls.\nWith that in mind, beginning today, Tax Day, we\u2019re making our real-time feed of IRS call-back scammers available for free. We\u2019re hoping that all phone companies will use this data to help end one of the most notorious and dangerous robocall scams of all time.\nIf we work together, consumers can experience a small break against what is annually one of the world\u2019s worst periods for robocall scams. None of this will cost consumers anything, nor will carriers have to pay for access to the list.\nBy working together with the carriers and other stakeholders in the communications industry, we are confident that the robocall epidemic can ultimately be stopped. It will take time, technology, and cooperation. This latest initiative encapsulates all three of those aspects and will bring some immediate relief not only to consumers, but also the IRS itself, who is also a victim of these scams.\nFor more information on this effort, please go to nomorobo.com/irs.", "version": "v0"}

That opportunity has led to a flood of robotics-themed investment products hitting the market in the past 24 months. Navigating this expanding landscape can be a complex and time-consuming puzzle.\nThe challenge is by no means restricted to RAAI. Today, it seems there\u2019s an index available to tackle nearly every theme and style an investor can dream up. In general, that\u2019s good news. A larger menu means more choice, and the more options to choose from, the better. At the same time, understanding precisely what those options actually are can be a challenge\u2014even for experienced investors and portfolio managers. While solution providers may be highly adept at defining and marketing a specific theme or investing style, it\u2019s rare to find a prospectus that goes beyond the basics, such as how an index is constructed, how often it is rebalanced, the index turnover rate, performance history, and track record. But the finer details matter\u2014especially if your goal is to utilize a product that tracks the index to bolster your core portfolio.\nROBO Global was the first to recognize the need to track robotics, automation, and artificial intelligence, and in 2013 became the first to launch an index to track the significant potential of the theme: the ROBO Global Robotics & Automation Index\u00ae. The index was built deliberately to be broad in scope and diversified across market cap, geography, and technologies to take advantage of the uniquely cyclical nature of pure-play and emerging pure-play technology providers. Our goal was to capitalize on the growth and contraction of each sector of the market over time. That strategy has delivered. Today, the ROBO Global Robotics & Automation Index has more than $2.5B in global assets under management, making it the largest dedicated robotics, automation, and AI index on the market today.\nIn the past four years, investors have become more sophisticated in their understanding of RAAI and its growth potential. In support of investor due diligence when researching and selecting a suitable strategy, ROBO Global has created a series of sub-indices to streamline the process of analyzing individual models and their ability to support specific investment goals.\nTo further support investor due diligence, Price Return and Total Net Returns versions of each index are also available, including 10 years of past-performance history. (Data prior to 16 June 2014 is based on simulated back-tested data.) Using this granular breakout of the index enables investors to more easily model and analyze each of the various components of the index and how each may help strengthen positions within a portfolio.\nAt ROBO Global, we still believe that the most efficient way to invest in robotics, automation, and AI is to invest broadly to help balance risk with reward across the sector. Toward that goal, ROBO Global invests across the global value chain of RAAI, investing in industry leaders with all levels of market capitalization, across all major geographic regions. In stark contrast to other strategies, the ROBO Global Robotics & Automation Index is modified equal-weighted\u2014not capitalization-weighted. This weighting provides investors with equally diversified equity exposure, including more exposure to the small-cap and mid-cap companies that may have a higher growth potential.\nWise investors know that investing success is rooted not in chasing the latest trends, but in careful selection based on due diligence\u2014including analysis to understand how the underlying holdings contribute to the strength of the overall portfolio. ROBO Global\u2019s sub-index series is designed to do just that, and to give investors the ability to capture the potential growth across the sector more easily than ever.", "version": "v0"}

Please use only one of the following methods.\nThen any user logging in using the bash shell (only) will be automatically logged out without any warning after 30 minutes of inactivity. The ssh screen itself will be closed.\n3) Using an OpenSSH server's ClientAliveInterval, it is possible for the ssh server to send periodic \"keep alive\" messages to the ssh client, keeping the connection open indefinitely. This is useful when a firewall or other packet filtering device drops idle connections after a certain period of time.\nb. Reload the sshd server configuration with \"service sshd reload\"\nNote: you may want to configure the ClientAliveCountMax value in sshd_config to set the number of times that \"keep alive\" messages are sent. If ClientAliveCountMax number of \"keep alive\" messages are not acknowledged by the ssh client, the connection is terminated by the ssh server. The default value of 3 should be sufficient for most users.\nNote: You can use Centrify SSH group policies to set up ClientAliveInterval, refer to our Group Policy guide on how to do this.\nNote: Centrify is not responsible if none of the above solutions work as this is outside the scope of the product.

Data were acquired from regions of interest in the liver and spleen by using time series of single-breath-hold symmetrically sampled two-point Dixon 3D images (non-enhanced, arterial and venous portal phase; 3, 10, 20 and 30 min) following a bolus injection of Gd-EOB-DTPA (0.025 mmol/kg). The signal intensity (SI) values were reconstructed using a phase-sensitive technique and normalised using multiscale adaptive normalising averaging (MANA). Liver-to-spleen contrast ratios (LSC_N) and the contrast uptake rate (KHep) were calculated. Liver biopsy was performed and classified according to the Batts and Ludwig system.\nArea under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values of 0.71, 0.80 and 0.78, respectively, were found for KHep, LSC_N10 and LSC_N20 with regard to severe versus mild fibrosis. Significant group differences were found for KHep (borderline), LSC_N10 and LSC_N20.\nLiver fibrosis stage strongly influences the hepatocyte-specific uptake of Gd-EOB-DTPA. Potentially the normalisation technique and KHep will reduce patient and system bias, yielding a robust approach to non-invasive liver function determination.\nLink\u00f6pings universitet, Institutionen f\u00f6r medicin och h\u00e4lsa, Medicinsk radiologi.

Patients with histopathologically proven diffuse liver disease (n = 9) and healthy individuals (n = 12) were examined. The patients had significantly lower concentrations of phosphodiesters (PDE) and ATP compared with controls. Constructing an \u2018anabolic charge\u2019 (AC) based on absolute concentrations, [PME] / ([PME] + [PDE]), the patients had a significant larger AC than the control subjects.\nThe MRS technique was then, in a second study, applied on two distinct groups of patients, one group with steatosis and none-to-moderate inflammation (n = 13) and one group with severe fibrosis or cirrhosis (n = 16). A control group (n = 13) was also included. Lower concentrations of PDE and a higher AC were found in the cirrhosis group compared to the control group. Also compared to the steatosis group, the cirrhosis group had lower concentrations of PDE and a higher AC. A significant correlation between fibrosis stage and PDE and fibrosis stage and AC was found. Using an AC cut-off value of 0.27 to discriminate between mild (stage 0-2) and advanced (stage 3-4) fibrosis yielded an AUROC value of 0.78, similar as for discriminating between F0-1 vs. F2-4.\nDynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) was performed prospectively in a third study on 38 patients referred for evaluation of elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels. Data were acquired from regions of interest in the liver and spleen by using single-breath-hold symmetrically sampled two-point Dixon 3D images time-series (non-enhanced, arterial and venous portal phase; 3, 10, 20 and 30 min) following a bolus injection of Gd-EOB-DTPA (0.025 mmol/kg). A new quantification procedure for calculation of the \u2018hepatocyte specific uptake rate\u2019, KHep, was applied on a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model. Liver-to-spleen contrast ratios (LSC_N) were also calculated. AUROC values of 0.71, 0.80 and 0.78, respectively, were found for KHep, LSC_N10 and LSC_N20 with regard to severe versus mild fibrosis. Significant group differences were found for KHep (borderline), LSC_N10 and LSC_N20.\nIn study four no significant correlation between visual assessments of bile ducts excretion of Gd-EOB-DTPA and histo-pathological grading of fibrosis or the quantified uptake of Gd-EOB-DTPA defined as KHep and LSC_N.\nIn conclusion 31P-MRS and DCE-MRI show promising results for achieving a non-invasive approach in discriminating different levels of fibrosis from each other.\nLink\u00f6pings universitet, Centrum f\u00f6r medicinsk bildvetenskap och visualisering, CMIV.

The number of people suffering from chronic liver disease is on the rise, likely due to the present \u2018western\u2019 lifestyle. As disease develops in the liver there are pathophysiological manifestations within the liver parenchyma that are both common and important to monitor. These manifestations include inflammation, fatty infiltration (steatosis), excessive scar tissue formation (fibrosis and cirrhosis), and iron loading. Importantly, as the disease progresses there is concurrent loss of liver function. Furthermore, postoperative liver function insufficiency is an important concern when planning surgical treatment of the liver, because it is associated with both morbidity and mortality. Liver function can also be hampered due to drug-induced injuries, an important aspect to consider in drug-development.\nCurrently, an invasive liver needle biopsy is required to determine the aetiology and to stage or grade the pathophysiological manifestations. There are important limitations with the biopsy, which include, risk of serious complications, mortality, morbidity, inter- and intra-observer variability, sampling error, and sampling variability. Cleary, it would be beneficial to be able investigate the pathophysiological manifestations accurately, non-invasively, and on regional level.\nCurrent available laboratory liver function blood panels are typically insufficient and often only indicate damage at a late stage. Thus, it would be beneficial to have access to biomarkers that are both sensitive and responds to early changes in liver function in both clinical settings and for the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory agencies.\nThe main aim of this thesis was to develop and evaluate methods that can be used for a \u2018non-invasive liver biopsy\u2019 using magnetic resonance (MR). We also aimed to develop sensitive methods for measure liver function based on gadoxetate-enhanced MR imaging (MRI).\nThe presented work is primarily based on a prospective study on c. 100 patients suffering from chronic liver disease of varying aetiologies recruited due to elevated liver enzyme levels, without clear signs of decompensated cirrhosis. Our results show that the commonly used liver fat cut-off for diagnosing steatosis should be lowered from 5% to 3% when using MR proton-density fat fraction (PDFF). We also show that MR elastography (MRE) is superior in staging fibrosis.\nFinally we presented a framework for quantifying liver function based on gadoxetate-enhanced MRI. The method is based on clinical images and a clinical approved contrast agent (gadoxetate). The framework consists of; state-of the-art image reconstruction and correction methods, a mathematical model, and a precise model parametrization method. The model was developed and validated on healthy subjects. Thereafter the model was found applicable on the chronic liver disease cohort as well as validated using gadoxetate levels in biopsy samples and blood samples. The liver function parameters correlated with clinical markers for liver function and liver fibrosis (used as a surrogate marker for liver function).\nIn summary, it should be possible to perform a non-invasive liver biopsy using: MRI-PDFF for liver fat and iron loading, MRE for liver fibrosis and possibly also inflammation, and measure liver function using the presented framework for analysing gadoxetate-enhanced MRI. With the exception of an MREtransducer no additional hardware is required on the MR scanner. The liver function method is likely to be useful both in a clinical setting and in pharmaceutical trials.", "version": "v0"}

While many mountains plan to start on Black Friday, mother nature often has different ideas. The end of the season is even harder to pin down.\nThe season reminds me of the baseball calendar. Thin cover snowliage skiing is akin to spring training. The regular season begins on opening day and the All-Star break is Valentine\u2019s Day. But the analogy breaks down because end of the regular season is always a moving target.\nBased on what I read on Facebook and in the Forums, last weekend was seen by many as the end. Several mountains called it on Sunday leaving more hills closed than open.\nThe good news was that sun finally came out and warmed things up for some proper spring skiing. Those who hung in late in the day Saturday got to ski soft snow and the trees were in play. Sunday was game-on from the opening bell.\nBy midmorning at Gore and across the Northeast a party atmosphere was pervasive. We arrived a bit later than usual and started on Gore\u2019s sunny, low elevation, front side terrain.\nOur eight-year-old Neve was pushing us to head to the top from the moment we arrived. I tried to explain that skiing in the spring is different than mid-winter, where often the top has the best snow.\nAs the East Side got sloppy we moved on to the North. More shaded and with a higher base elevation, it was the next logical step. We had that side completely to ourselves, and I eyed up the Tahawas Trees, which were closed but looked prime.\nFinally we went head to the High Peaks Chair where we faced an inevitable contradiction. While Neve always seems to push us to \u201cgo to the top\u201d she has been struggling relatively new fear of black trails. At Gore, that doesn\u2019t leave much to ski at the summit.\nWe don\u2019t generally push Neve, but today Zelda went where no man (in our family) has gone before. She was relentless with her suggestion that she try Open Pit, one of the easier expert rated trails on the mountain.\nFirsts for her included Chatiemac, Hawkeye and the bumps under that Straightbrook Liftline. (Woohoo!) I\u2019m not kidding myself into thinking that we\u2019ve moved beyond the fear of expert terrain, but it felt like a very big day.\nNear the end of the day I crossed trails with the Darkside Shaman who gave us a heads up. Tahawas Trees were open and skiing like a dream. It was the perfect opportunity to finish the day on some fun bumps to further boost Neve\u2019s confidence.\nWhile Gore should have another great weekend coming up, like many skiers, my girls are done for the year. I\u2019m still holding out hope I\u2019ll make it into the playoffs at Killington or the World Series on Mount Washington.\nHope to be there Sunday!\nAll I have to say is that after this weekend, it\u2019s going to be \u201cGo East young man\u201d. There is still a few weeks of spinning lifts East (or North) of New York State.\nHope to ski with a few of you this weekend. Harv, perhaps we can talk about that growing fear issue with our girls. My 7yo daughter experienced the same thing this year. Skiing big/steep blacks all last winter only to have improved her skills but decreased her desire. I pushed her a bit, but did not want to be the guy with a crying kid. When I did, she would ski easily, say it was easy (skiing very well) but advise she was one-and-done.\nIt also makes me feel better know other (non-PANDAS I\u2019m assuming) kids are growing into fears. Maybe it is normal and not a function of her condition.\nUnfortunately I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get to Gore this weekend. Was holding out hope for Plattekill Sunday, but at this moment I don\u2019t think they will be spinning.\nkids love to ski with other kids. you will figure it out and meet more families. i usually wound up with all the kids because i was one of the few parents who could take them into the woods. it was great and i kind of miss it.\nClosing weekend was a blast. I hope to do a report on my thoughts.\nOn kids skiing together, there is no better teacher/motivator in my view. My daughter found a way to find kids/groups to ski with that were below her skill\u2026.so she did not have to push herself. Small mountain with lots of kids, who all hang out. I am not worried and know she will grow out. This seems to occur to a % of kids, though more so with the lil, ladies. Maybe the boys feel the same way but are not \u201cman\u201d enough to admit it. I find the gals do better (at this age anyway) in dealing with adverse peer pressure.", "version": "v0"}

These are two sides of the same coin. Just as a coin would be incomplete without both the sides, our life too would be incomplete without both these aspects - the pursuit of spiritual knowledge and devotion, and at the same time devoting some time to service. This is what great gurus in India teach; to compliment sadhana with seva. Thanks once again for this lovely message.\nvery nice Jan thanks for sharing this heartfelt sentiments with me. your thoughts and posts are always welcome!\nLets help one and other when in need.\nI think this works everywhere. Even in business good deeds will work to create more business eventually. It could even be a called a good investment. The opposite greed and self centered methods tend to isolate. Not all help is always to do with money. What I mean is attitudes are reflected and they tend to give us a reputation. Just for our own peace of mind helping others can be very beneficial for everyone.", "version": "v0"}

And this is definitely a case of bigger is better. Giant gets great reviews for their road bikes, mountain bikes, hybrid bikes, and electric bikes (all of which are available at Bike Shop LA).\nGiant Bicycles is a Taiwanese bicycle and equipment manufacturer founded in 1972 by businessman King Liu and several friends. Originally, Giant was an equipment manufacturer, and made bicycles to be sold under other brand names (such as Schwinn cruiser bikes).\nIn 1981, the first Giant-branded bikes started hitting shelves and showing up on roads. They first entered the market in Taiwan, then expanded into Europe, North America, and other biking hubs around the world.\nGiant Bicycles is known for the compact road design, which features a sloping top tube and a smaller rear triangle. By combining those, Giant makes road bike frames lighter, stiffer, and more responsive.\nYou\u2019ll get more torsional steering stiffness from Giants because they have tapered head tubes (known as OverDrive). If any of this sounds confusing to you, visit us at Bike Shop LA to take a test ride. While you are here, we\u2019ll talk to you about what kind of bike best suits your needs.\nYou\u2019ll be able to handle the most rugged off-road terrain with our Giant mountain bikes for sale. They\u2019re built tough, with aggressive, knobby tires, so you\u2019ll get good traction on almost any surface. Plus, powerful stopping control is literally at your fingertips with mountain bike disc brakes.\nTo ride fast on paved roads, saddle up on one of Giants road bikes. With narrow tires and an aggressive, compact road bike frame, you\u2019ll get maximum speed for less effort on a Giant. These are sometimes called \u201cendurance\u201d bikes because riders end up taking them out for hours at a time.\nHybrid bikes are called \u201chybrids\u201d because they take the comfort of a mountain bike and combine it with faster rolling wheels and a lighter-weight frame (typical qualities of a road bike).\nThe latest trend in cycling is electric bikes\u2014and Giant Bicycles has a great e-option. You still get exercise from pedaling, but you get an extra push from the electric bike\u2019s motor. Electric bikes are great for commuters (saving you from sweat and getting you there faster), for people who encounter lots of hills on their rides, and just for plain fun.\nRead about Bike Shop LA\u2019s selection of Giant Bicycles here, or stop by our shop to check them out!", "version": "v0"}

It opened up a huge debate about consent and what it looks like.\nWe realised that consent has a lot of grey areas and wanted to start a conversation about the spaces in between the black and white of consent; it\u2019s not as straightforward as no means no.\nHow was the idea put into action?\nWe put a Facebook post out asking women to share occasions when they had tried to say stop or slow down a sexual encounter without using the words.\nWe received hundreds of statements from women from around the world.\nWe then took 50 of those statements and created T-shirts which were made available for sale on an e-commerce site. And we asked 50 influencers to wear and post a pic on International Women\u2019s Day.\nOur aim was to start a conversation about consent, and in particular, enthusiastic consent.\nNot only have we started a conversation about consent, but we have had contact with other countries and organisations wanting to replicate the idea in their own region.\nWe\u2019re also in conversations with universities and various festivals and support groups about consent education and how to change the conversation.\nUltimately we would love to see legislation changed as to what constitutes consent.\nThe Saxon Mullins case in NSW highlights the need for this clear understanding of what consent is. It\u2019s not just hearing someone say \u2018No\u2019. There are many ways we communicate, and this campaign is about those subtleties of that communication.\nWhat has been the benefit of using such a diverse group of women to demonstrate the issue?\nWe\u2019ve reached a very broad audience.\nThis issue about enthusiastic consent affects everyone; men and women. Women want to be heard and men have been very open to being educated and enlightened as to how we communicate. It\u2019s been educational for everyone.\nHow have you used social media to generate attention?\nThe entire campaign was driven by social media.\nWe\u2019ve used Instagram and Facebook to drive the entire campaign. Recruiting influencers, and having everyone tag and share.\nWhat have been the ripple effects?\nProbably the biggest one is the cathartic and healing effect it seems to have had on people who have experienced sexual assault. Buying and wearing a t-shirt has helped them to heal their own personal experiences, and to communicate both online, and offline, with those around them.\nAnd the realisation that it is more than one day, International Women\u2019s Day. The campaign has a life of its own now and education and working with universities and schools is now our focus for stage 2.\nAs well as the global reach.\nWhat do you make of the Cannes nom?\nTo be the only Australian work shortlisted for a Glass Lion is amazing. Especially when we look at the company we\u2019re in.\nWe\u2019re a small group of individuals from Melbourne who set out to create a campaign that would start a conversation. We\u2019re in the company of Nike, Coca-Cola, Dove, global agency groups. It\u2019s pretty humbling.\nHow can an event like Cannes help generate attention to this issue?\nThe platform and audience in Cannes is huge, and I intend to use the 20 minutes I have in front of the Jury and delegates, to further callout for support, conversation, and awareness.\nThis is about a conversation and we\u2019re already in discussions with other countries about running their own campaigns. Cannes is a great platform to drive further conversation.\nWe\u2019re in the business of communication and I have a week to communicate with a huge melting pot of people from advertising throughout the world.\nIn an industry driven by consumption, to be able to use creativity to affect change is so rewarding.\nHow intertwined is this issue and the advertising industry in Australia and worldwide?\nI wouldn\u2019t say the consent conversation is exclusive to any particular industry.\nIt\u2019s about education and how we raise and condition boys and girls. How we represent relationships in the media and conditioning of both sexes from birth.\nThat\u2019s something well outside of any workplace or industry.\nWhat is still the biggest hurdle for 50 Shades, and the industry more generally?\nI think our industry is making great strides in recognising talent of all genders and minorities.\nI know there are the naysayers about quotas and this whole female push, but it will only be temporary until there is a balance and this ingrained unconscious bias starts dissolving away.\nEveryone needs to be recognised for their talents, regardless of gender.\nFor so long, women\u2019s gender was clouding any recognition they may have received. Now that is slowly falling away, which is progress.\nWe started 50 Shades of No in response to the International Women\u2019s Day #pressforprogress, and I think we\u2019re slowly getting somewhere.", "version": "v0"}

It is my expectation that it takes me very little manual effort to run the full 12.2.0.1 Oracle Enterprise Database \u2013 just pull and run the Docker image. Once it is running, I get the usual Docker benefits such as clean environment management, linking from other containers, quick stop and start, running scripts inside the container etc.\nThe minimum requirements for the container is 8GB of disk space and 2GB of memory. There is a slim alternative that requires less resources: The slim (12.2.0.1-slim) version of EE does not have support for Analytics, Oracle R, Oracle Label Security, Oracle Text, Oracle Application Express and Oracle DataVault. I am not sure yet how much that shaves of the resource requirements.\nMy recent article Quick introduction to Oracle Container Registry\u2013running one of Oracle\u2019s prebaked images explained the first steps for getting started with Oracle Container Registry, including how to sign up and accept terms and conditions for individual images.\nOnce that is out of the way, we can get going with running the database.\nstart interacting with the database, for example from SQLcl or SQL Developer.\nIn terms of work, it will take less than two minutes of your time. The time before the database is running is mainly determined by the time it takes to download the image. After that, running the container takes just a few dozens of seconds.\nCopy the docker pull command in the upper right hand corner to the clipboard. It is also worth remembering the docker run command for running the database image.\nAfter starting Docker (on my laptop I am using the Docker Quick Start Terminal in the Docker Toolbox), login to the container registry using your Oracle account.\nThe download took over three and a half hours. I was doing stuff over that time \u2013 so no time lost.\nOnce the pull was finished, the image was added to the local cache of Docker images.

And are not available elsewhere nor will they survive the removal of the container. A better way of handling these files is through the mounting of a host folder for storing files or through a Docker Volume.\nI know this article is over a year old now, but I just wanted to say thanks for posting the default password for the container\u2019s database!\nSorry when i did according to your guide why still reported error?\nHow do I \u201clogin to the Oracle registry\u201d?

In the clubhouse\u2019s final form, the sheltered driving-range tees back onto the lounge and relaxation areas, creating a unique experience for golfers.\nThe clubhouse\u2019s architectural signature is a direct response to the nature of the project. The building\u2019s curve, echoing the driving range, harmonizes with the setting while meeting the needs of golfers working on their game. The exceptional size of the wooden roof\u2019s cantilevers, dictated by the need to provide adequate shelter from the elements, also led to the creation of a contemplative space for golfers. The plan\u2019s precision is evident in the clubhouse\u2019s ample windows and distinct arrangement of materials: zinc, wood and glass.\nThe building\u2019s curvilinear layout is structured by traffic areas separating outdoor sporting activities and the clubhouse\u2019s interior functions, which are arranged sequentially. The reception hall, on the west side, opens onto a sheltered outdoor space with views of downtown Montreal. Next is the first of two windowless service cores, with washrooms and two soundproofed rooms where members can work on their game using golf simulators. The adjacent lounge is a large open space featuring a variety of seating types arranged around a central bar. After that comes the hall, which cuts across the building to provide access to the driving range, which is near the pro shop and a service counter for the open kitchen. Lastly, a second windowless service core houses the kitchen, administrative offices and mechanical rooms.\nDesigned to make the spaces as flexible as possible, the clubhouse is a gathering place suitable for many kinds of activities and events, both during and outside golf season.\nThe roof\u2019s span impresses by its size and the structural challenge it represents. The successful construction of the roof required precision design work to ensure a harmonious relationship between the structure\u2019s exterior and interior proportions. The curves of both the roof and building, back and front, give the clubhouse a refined touch. The electro-mechanical elements are carefully integrated into the wooden structure, making them disappear and leaving the interior as minimalist as possible. Special care was taken to select VOC-free natural materials, hence the use of wood throughout the interior: walls and doors in maple paneling, walls in toasted wood, and furniture. Lastly, with the aim of showcasing local expertise and artisans, the architects made a point of selecting materials, suppliers and contractors from Montreal and elsewhere in Quebec.\nIn 1955, six architects with strong personalities and a variety of backgrounds founded the firm of Affleck, Desbarats, Dimakopoulos, Lebensold, Michaud & Sise. For more than 30 years, starting in the 1970s, the firm operated as Arcop, an acronym for Architects in co-partnership. Throughout its long history, the firm has had a strong influence on architecture in Quebec and across Canada.\nIn 2014, six architecture studios joined forces and pooled their expertise and complementary talents to create a single Canada-wide firm, Architecture49.

But mostly, since you can\u2019t celebrate championships or even a great playoff run, you enjoy the little things, like waiting for an unexpected free agent signing, seeing if they can pull off any interesting trades or a great draft.\nIn other words, you keep believing that better times lie just ahead.\nI read a comment from the Leafs\u2019 Director of Amateur scouting the other day, which reinforced for me the notion that Burke will do everything he can not to have his scouts sitting idly by come draft day. Burke has said many times he doesn\u2019t want these guys, who work hard all year long, to be sitting around with nothing to do for two rounds.\nI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s about trying to \u201cmake up\u201d for the lost opportunity to get either Tyler Seguin or Taylor Hall, because Burke loves Kessel. That trade will, rightly so, be debated for years to come, as we\u2019ll all assess how each of the players- and teams- involved do. But for Burke, that\u2019s old news.\nIt\u2019s more that he knows that you need good youngsters in the pipeline, and the best way to make that happen is still the draft. He\u2019s done a good job of signing U.S. college free agents like Bozak along with Europeans like Gustavsson, and that certainly helps. But you need to stockpile draft choices, so if he can move someone and get back a pick \u2013 even a second-rounder- without disturbing his \u201cplan\u201d, he will do it.\nThe biggest pieces he has to move right now are the much-discussed Tomas Kaberle (that will happen) and young Luke Schenn. Either player could net some interesting returns.\nMy reference to Schenn is based purely on my own thought that he was not a Burke draftee, and while he showed progress in the second half of his sophomore season, I wonder if the Leafs believe he has a much higher ceiling.\nI realize that to deal a young defenseman with such apparent promise would seem to be totally against Burke\u2019s often-repeated mantra of building from the back end- in goal and on defense. And since they are already planning to move Kaberle, they likely wouldn\u2019t be keen on moving a 21 year-old former number one draft choice that they still control from a contractual standpoint. They don\u2019t have a lot of high-end depth on the back end and losing two defenders without capable replacements at the ready would leave them short-handed.\nBurke does surprising things, and usually goes big. So I\u2019m sensing he makes a deal on the draft floor to get into the first round- and into the top 10.", "version": "v0"}

Some of these are not manageable with DynamicComponent and DynamicCompanion, but I must say that these are two excellent components and I thank the authors.\nhi, will be ever possible to create arrangements too in which create buttons, label etc?\nhi, is it possible to add a number only property to the textbox?", "version": "v0"}

Dealing with a nuclear North Korea. This is a hard problem. I know. I\u2019ve been working on it since the early 1990s, including when I was the U.S. government lead monitor at the Yongbyon nuclear facility in 1995-1996. Despite America\u2019s best efforts, North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs could soon threaten the United States directly. Having crossed the nuclear threshold in the early 1990s, North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong Un has made clear possession of nuclear capabilities and advancement of missile technology are his definition of power and control. He will not willingly give them up. President Trump drew an early red line Tweeting that a North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) flight \u201cwon\u2019t happen\u201d, practically daring Kim to test the new U.S. leadership. How President Trump\u2019s national security team decides to address this creeping crisis \u2014 through deterrence, containment, enhanced pressure, or even military prevention \u2014 while reassuring our critical allies, South Korea and Japan, will be a key challenge. Kim will want their answer sooner than they think.\n2. Nuclear relations with Russia. It remains unclear how President Trump intends to deal with Russia\u2019s aggression in Europe and nuclear saber-rattling. During the final years of Obama\u2019s term, we were increasingly concerned that any crisis with Moscow could spiral out of control and lead to early use of nuclear weapons by Russia. Putin\u2019s paranoia that our goal was regime change was that strong. Why do you think we worked so hard to avoid a military accident over the skies of Syria? Softer words between Presidents Trump and Putin are nice but won\u2019t ease Moscow\u2019s fear that Washington seeks an ability to conduct a \u201csplendid first-strike\u201d that could eliminate most Russian nuclear missiles using advanced conventional weapons, leaving only handful to be mopped up by increasingly capable missile defense. How the White House navigates its desire to advance missile defense and military spending while defusing Russian nuclear fears also remains to be seen.\n3. The nuclear future of Iran. Republicans made no secret of their hatred for the nuclear deal with Iran known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. They may as well have called it ObamaDeal. Of course, now that we are out of office those who demanded the deal be killed don\u2019t think it quite so bad. In reality, if the JCPOA is implemented it will prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon for decades, if not permanently. But the agreement requires constant care and feeding. And we have seen Republicans torpedo similar effective nonproliferation agreements before. The 1994 Agreed Framework with North Korea \u2014 also negotiated by a democratic president and hated by GOP \u2014 froze that country\u2019s nuclear program for 8 years, until Newt Gingrich\u2019s Congress froze funds to implement the deal. Instead of begging for a new deal, North Korea developed new nuclear facilities and was off to the races. Repeating this death by 1,000 cuts with Iran would be the definition of insanity \u2014 doing the same but expecting a different result. Whether President Trump\u2019s team will have their heart in preserving the JCPOA remains to be seen, but allowing it to collapse has predictable results.\n4. Preventing nuclear terrorism. Among the many successes of the Obama administration, perhaps none is as underappreciated as the Nuclear Security Summit process. Over eight years, four summits and countless hours of hard, under-the-radar work, enough nuclear material for hundreds of weapons from dozens of countries is no longer at risk of theft by nuclear terrorists. But there remain many caches of nuclear stocks in places where it should not be allowed to remain. How Trump convinces these states with nuclear materials to comply with global standards and give up their goods is a key question. How he does it when he seems to also be willing to undermine our relations with allies and global partners is a better question.\n5. Walking the razors edge on disarmament. How does the old adage go? You catch more nuclear diplomats with honey than with vinegar? There are an increasing number of countries that have grown impatient with the pace of nuclear disarmament \u2014 and for some reason. Several of these states have launched U.N.-sponsored negotiations to create a legally binding global ban on nuclear weapons. Now if the Trump team was irritated at the U.N. before, wait until they hear about this! But this centrist approach \u2014 to defend the step-by-step pace of disarmament that has reduced the number of U.S. nuclear weapons to a 50 year low \u2014 may not be popular with the Ban crowd, or with key actors in the new administration, but it has been essential to keeping wavering U.S. allies in Japan, Germany, Holland, and others from backing the ban movement. Losing allied states to the dangerous extreme of a global ban treaty could put the existing nonproliferation regime under pressure and weaken the norms at the very moment we need them most. How we get states like India, Pakistan, China, and North Korea to show nuclear restraint when we are throwing the old rules under the bus will be a pretty dicey proposition.\nThere are too many ways in which nuclear weapon issues can go sideways. Accidents, mistakes, conflicts that get out of control \u2014 these can happen at any time, and no administration is ever fully prepared. But these five issues are real and persistent and will test the new team soon. Getting out of the gate cleanly \u2014 something they have not been able to do on foreign policy \u2014 is essential. Without it, the new team can find themselves playing Whac-a-mole with nuclear weapons. Not a great way to make America great again.", "version": "v0"}

Worldwide, more than 30 journalists have been killed by criminal organizations since the start of 2017, RSF learned in the course of several months of research for this report, in which it interviewed many targeted journalists, their colleagues and their families.\nSome of those interviewed are getting round-the-clock police protection after being threatened by organized crime in connection with their reporting. Some describe how criminal groups set fire to their homes or targeted their families. Others talk about the colleagues or family members who went missing or were murdered in connection with their reporting. Organized crime hates publicity and stops at nothing to silence overly curious journalists, everyone said.\nOrganized crime knows no borders. At least ten journalists have been killed by organized crime this year in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, where the drug cartels hold sway. The actual figure could be much higher because criminals and politicians often ally against journalists and impunity reigns in the countries. In India, Cambodia and some African countries, criminal groups make a fortune from breaking all the environmental rules in order to plunder natural resources. Journalists who shed light on trafficking in minerals, timber and petroleum are exposed to terrible reprisals. Sandeep Sharma, an Indian journalist who investigated a local \u201csand mafia\u201d was deliberately run down and killed by a dumper truck in March.\nEurope has not been spared. At least two of its investigative reporters have been murdered in connection with their work in the past two years: Daphne Caruana Galizia, blown up a bomb under her car in Malta in October 2017, and J\u00e1n Kuciak, shot dead at his home in Slovakia, together with his fianc\u00e9e, in February 2018. Both of these journalists had taken an interest in the Italian mafia\u2019s activities in their own countries, in particular, shady financial dealings allegedly involving local businessmen and politicians. In Italy, Roberto Saviano is one of a total ten journalists who are protected day and night by police bodyguards. Paolo Borrometti, the target of a mafia murder plot in Sicily this year, is another. In all, more than 200 Italian journalists received some kind of police protection last year.\nWhat can journalists do in the face of organized crime\u2019s far-reaching influence, in which officials often collude, at least passively? How can they continue to work when they know that organized crime stops at nothing, when they know they are putting themselves and their families at risk? In Japan, the yakuza had no qualms about murdering the well-known journalist Mizoguchi Atsushi\u2019s son in retaliation for his reporting in 2006. Self-censorship has been the rule ever since.\nIn the face of such violence, some journalists have given up. This was the painful decision that the owner of the Mexican newspaper Norte de Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez took after one of his top reporters, Miroslava Breach, was murdered last year. Others, such as Pavla Holcov\u00e1, a Czech journalist who collaborated with Kuciak, wield their pens as defensive weapons, regarding their coverage of this or that criminal group\u2019s illegal activities as the best way of protecting themselves. But this means teaming up with other reporters in order to reduce the risks. It\u2019s what more and more journalists are doing \u2013 pooling their efforts and working on joint investigations within major international consortiums.

His father had served in the Royal Flying Corps in World War 1 (which became the RAF on 1 April 1918 when the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service were merged).\nTheo\u2019s father was a jeweller and returned to his trade in the jewellery quarter in Birmingham after the end of World War 1 although he was retained as an RAF Reserve. This involved undertaking two weeks training each year and in July 1939, before the start of World War 2, he was called up for his usual training and didn\u2019t return home until the end of the war, since he was re-enlisted in the RAF.\nWhen war broke out in September 1939, Theo was 16 and attending Handsworth Grammar School. In 1940 his father arranged for him to have a flight in an Avro Anson airplane when the crew were undertaking bombing practice in the Bristol Channel with 12 lb bombs. The Avro Anson has windows along each side of the plane and Theo was seated just behind the pilot, getting an excellent view of the target practice and he describes it as the most exciting thing that could happen for a 17 year old schoolboy and at that moment he decided he wanted to join the RAF. At about this time Theo\u2019s school (Handsworth Grammar School in Birmingham) was evacuated to Gloucestershire so Theo made the decision to leave school and work (as a booking clerk at Birmingham New Street Station) until he was old enough to enlist. He did this in November 1941, volunteering for the RAF and was called up in February 1942.\nTheo was trained as a wireless (radio) operator, having to learn the Morse Code (and still can translate text into Morse in his 90\u2019s, it was so well drilled) and reach the standard of 23 words per minute. Training involved flying in a Proctor airplane transmitting and receiving messages in flight. Upon qualification he was awarded Sergeant stripes and was sent with other graduates of the training programme through the Mediterranean to Port Said, to Alexandria and into the Canal Zone. The group crewed up on the way out \u2013 as was custom in the RAF it was left to the men to sort themselves out into crews of 5 members for a Wellington bomber plane (a pilot, radio operator, navigator/bomb aimer, observer/nose gunner and tail gunner).\nThe Wellington bomber crews flew out of Italy once the Allied victory in North Africa Campaign in March 1943 enabled the invasion of Italy to be launched. They made raids in France, Germany, Italy & Greece and eastern targets in Hungary & Romania, targeting fuel depots, communication lines, and key military installations. In the Normandy Campaign Theo\u2019s crew were directed to attack Marseilles to disrupt the roads and railways & slow down any German troops directed towards Normandy.\nTheo completed 35 bombing raids, which constituted a \u2018Tour of Duty\u2019 when crew members were then put on light duties for 6 months to help address the stress of battle they had under-gone.\nTheo was discharged from the RAF in 1946 and returned to his home in Sutton Coldfield (near Birmingham) to marry his fianc\u00e9e of 3 years.\nAfter the war Theo trained as a teacher and ended his career as Head Teacher before embarking on a long and very active retirement. Theo joined Normandy Veterans and Friends in 2016 and has been a loyal supporter of the Legacy project, undertaking visits to primary and secondary schools to share his World War 2 experiences as part of \u2018living history\u2019.", "version": "v0"}

A truckers\u2019 GPS navigation system lets you customize your route based on your truck\u2019s size, weight and cargo, drive through preferred areas and also offers features like a built-in dash cam and driver awareness functions made to help you stay alert, which can be a real asset during long journeys.\nMake trekking through the wild simpler with a handheld GPS unit. Crafted more ruggedly than a vehicle\u2019s GPS, handheld systems often boast water-resistant housings that are made to handle the elements and long-lasting batteries that keep the device powered for weeks. When you go off grid, you can feel a little safer with features like 24/7 search and rescue monitoring and an SOS function as well as vivid screens that display preloaded maps and your custom routes.", "version": "v0"}

Acura NSX, which is basically the Honda NSX version that is marketed in North America, combines the typical Honda-like merits with supercar technology. The car promises to keep comfort and functional merits that signify typical Honda car, with powerful machine, economical fuel, and great control for comfortable driving.\nThis new NSX generation is likely to be a powerful beast. Despite using standard V6 engine for supercar with 3.0 l capacity, Acura can boosts up power as high as 270 hp in 5,500 rpm of angular speed. The engine performance is also matched with 285 nm torque in 4,400 rpm of angular speed. The engine is strong enough to support street performance and high-tech features this new NSX generation bears. However, more detailed engine specifications are still unclear, but Acura promises powerful performance that matches its futuristic design, with some innovations to improve road control system.\nOne typical feature of Acura NSX is the V6 engine that is not exactly connected with the rear wheels, which was intentionally done to improve the control range and handling options for the driver. The car is quite economical in fuel; one gallon of fuel can make the car runs as far as 17 miles in the city and 24 miles on rural roads or highways.\n\u2022 Lightweight design that consists of fiberglass composite, steel frame, aluminum, and floor made of carbon fiber.\n\u2022 Sleek, curved design for more aerodynamic element, complete with alloy wheels. The overall design and material provides better gravity center for proper handling and control.\n\u2022 Luxurious interior with patent leather, complete with keyless entrance, airbags for driver and passenger, rear defogger, and several antitheft devices.\n\u2022 Multiple driving modes such as electric mode and track setting.\nThere have been not enough details about Acura NSX, and the mentioned numbers of speed before are also speculation, although the actual speed and engine power are likely to match the predictions. Since Acura is likely to be released at the end of this year\u2019s spring, there has been no exact update about Acura NSX price. However, those who are interested of acquiring the latest Acura supercar should be prepared to spend between $150,000 and $160,000.\nWhile Honda might be identical with functional cars, it refuses to be left out in the current market of supercars. Honda NSX is the result of a decade-long development project, which was aimed to combine powerful performance, futuristic technology, and comfort as well as functionality in driving, just like how all Honda product lines have been associated. This practically changed everything we always knew about supercars (i.e. they are strong and powerful but hard to handle). Honda NSX will be a supercar that has extra comfort and usability like typical Honda products.\nHowever, Honda is not likely to let buyers fooled with these extra comfort and control. As the first supercar Honda will ever release, this model has gone through several modifications and reworks in its design projects, in order to face competition in the supercar market; with many other manufacturers strive to reduce as many bugs and defects as possible from their futuristic designs.\n\u2022 Twin turbo and three electric motors paired with 10 power engine coolers to balance performance with comfort and durability.\n\u2022 Luxurious two-seat interior with patent leather, air conditioners, driver and passenger airbags, sound system, antitheft devices, defogger, and heated side mirrors.\n\u2022 Alloy wheels with aluminum body, steel frame, and fiberglass composite for lighter movement and maneuver.\nAs the first supercar Honda ever produces, supercar enthusiasts expect highly from this manufacturer, especially since the supercar market has been filled with manufacturers that compete to apply the latest technology and new innovations. Despite the promise of performance and functionality, Honda also has challenge of ditching its \u201cfamily friendly\u201d car label in order to successfully promote its NSX car. Meanwhile, there is still no exact price information, but Honda NSX price is speculated to be about 120,000 Pound.\nAcura and Honda NSX are both projected to be the 2016 generation of supercar that combines powerful performance with comfort and functionality. While the prices are definitely exorbitant, but they are expected from the technology and new features applied on these cars. The NSX car from Honda is especially a result from decade-long of research, combining Honda\u2019s signature functionality and high technology features to create a new generation of supercar.\nThe cars are projected to have hybrid components and be fuel-efficient, which are the major issues and features that people look nowadays when looking for vehicles, even supercars. The new features applied on engine and overall design also make these cars are likely to have good balance, performance and handling, while being powerful at the same time. However, both Acura and Honda NSX face serious competition with the other manufacturers. There have been manufacturers that learnt flaws in old supercar models, and doing everything they can to reduce or eliminate those flaws.\nIf you look for new supercar that combines power, performance and functionality, you can expect to buy Acura and Honda NSX, which is likely to be released in the middle of 2016.\n7 Comments on \"Acura NSX and Honda NSX as the Best Supercars to Come Out in 2016\"\nExcellent insights, Denny ! Very important to know !\nGreat! Acura NSX and Honda NSX is just amazing.I really enjoyed your post.\nAcura NSX 2017 defeats this regular disagreement by consolidating probably the most exceptional car innovation as of now accessible with the absolute most captivating driving elements accessible from any period.\nIt has been so since a long time ago Honda had an unmitigated games auto in its line-up that you may scarcely recollect what the first Honda NSX was intended to do. The two-seat, mid-engined supercar expected to contend with the contemporary mid-engined Ferrari, however at a much less expensive cost. It did as such until it vanished from deal over 10 years back.\nAcura\u2019s most recent models\u2014TLX and ILX\u2014are identification built variants of existing Honda autos. So unmistakably the NSX has one challenging task: to demonstrate the world that Acura really implies business.\nHope that Acura NSX and Honda NSX will provide the best solutions for those who are looking for luxurious car with sophisticated features, more powerful performance, elegant design, and high efficiency\u2026.", "version": "v0"}

A measure of the success of the web is how long it took to reach 50 million users: it took broadcast radio 38 years and television 13 years. The web got there in four.\n4. Three quarters of UK adults use the web every day, but 4 million people still don\u2019t have access to it. There are 4 billion people worldwide who can\u2019t access the web.\n5. The availability of answers on the web means that we\u2019ve forgotten how to remember things \u2013 now that almost anything can be found in a few clicks online, it\u2019s hardly necessary to retain information anymore. Researchers believe this is making us superficial thinkers.\n6. The web isn\u2019t the same as the internet; the internet is the network of computers that sends information around the world; the web is just one of the applications that uses this network, in the form of millions of pages of data. I like the analogy of the postman and the letter.\n7. There are almost a billion websites globally, although \u2018only\u2019 around 180 million are active. Every month Google processes 100 billion queries, and of these, about 15% are questions that it has never seen before.\n8. The Observer columnist Henry Porter describes the worldwide web as \u201cnot merely the greatest invention since writing\u201d but \u201cthe most revolutionary event in the history of the human psyche since the first hunter-gatherers began to conceive of gods who had access to their most private thoughts\u201d.\n9. Our addiction to the web leads to some anti-social behaviours \u2013 according to The Times, 36% of children and 33% of adults use electronic devices during family meal times, amazingly that figure is 88% amongst 12 -14 year olds.\n10. This is my favourite \u2018fact\u2019 \u2013 the internet (including the web) weighs as much as one strawberry. Apparently, physicist Russell Seitz has worked this out based on some atomic physics assumptions and the billions and billions of \u2018data-in-motion\u2019 moving electrons on the internet, and come to a figure of 50 grams \u2013 the weight of a strawberry.\nSo happy birthday to the web, and happy birthday to Fingertips too \u2013 we are one year old this week, something only made possible by Sir Tim\u2019s vague but exciting invention.\nWe are often asked to recommend equipment to our customers and I\u2019m keen that we don\u2019t fall into the trap of pushing the \u2018latest thing\u2019 just because it\u2019s new. Often the newest model is out of the customer\u2019s price range and has way more bells and whistles than they need anyway.\nNot so the Motorola Moto G. It\u2019s not quite the latest thing \u2013 it\u2019s been around for 4 months now \u2013 but it is consistently written up as being the best budget smartphone (under \u00a3200) on the market. Having spent the last month listening to my teenage sons reviewing and debating the relative merits of virtually every smartphone out there, it strikes me that if you want a smartphone (and you\u2019re not wedded to Apple) there\u2019s little reason to buy anything more expensive than this one.\n1. Great price \u2013 it\u2019s about \u00a3135 for the basic model (although some stores are currently offering it for \u00a3100) and even if you choose the 16GB version so that you can store more music, photos or just more apps, you still only pay \u00a3158.\n2. Great screen \u2013 it\u2019s a 4.5\u2033 screen, which is bigger than my iPhone 4, with a resolution of 720p; if that is just Greek to you, it means the image quality is excellent, contrast is good and small text is easy to read. Also, I\u2019ve just been told, the viewing angle is amazing.\n3. Fast processing \u2013 the Moto G has a \u2018quad core processor\u2019 \u2013 this essentially means that loading speeds are really fast and the phone can perform lots of tasks at once. For example (says my son) you could make a call whilst sending an email, or watch You Tube while sending a text \u2013 if you were so inclined.\n4. It runs the latest version of Android \u2013 Kit Kat \u2013 which has the clever, hands-free feature of voice search, amongst many others.\nApparently the only downside is that the camera isn\u2019t brilliant \u2013 only 5 megapixels, as compared to the 8 MP camera in the iPhone 5 and 13MP in the Samsung Galaxy S4. But for most of us, the picture quality is perfectly adequate \u2013 particularly if you\u2019re just using it to post pictures to Facebook \u2013 or your blog. Don\u2019t forget it was only 5 or 6 years ago that the iPhone had a 2MP camera, and that was just fine.\nIn previous posts I have said you get what you pay for, but in the case of this smartphone, you definitely get a lot more than that.\nLet the music play on\u2026.", "version": "v0"}

With this announcement the company, which recently acquired Korean manufacturer Kumho Tire and is well-known for its Doublestar, Crossleader and Aosen brands has underlined its commitment to the Iberian tyre market.\nIn this regard, Antonio Smith has further stressed that Doublestar\u2019s products are manufactured in line with the requirements of European labelling, with attractive tyre designs, through the most modern production standards as shown by its state-of-the art intelligent 4.0 manufacturing plant.\nAs we have seen, in July 2018 Qingdao Doublestar Group completed the acquisition of a 45 per cent stake in the Korean tyre manufacturer, Kumho Tire Co. Inc. Doublestar and its Korean sister company Xingwei Korea Co. Ltd. signed a contract in April with the Korea Development Bank in order to purchase a stake of KDB in Kumho Tire worth US$ 607 million. With that, Doublestar became the major shareholder in Kumho Tire, while KDG and other creditors of Kumho will continue being the second major shareholder in the company, owning a 23 per cent share. The remaining 22 per cent of Kumho Tire will stay in private ownership.\nDoublestar is a 97-year-old Chinese tyre manufacturer, which is the only state-owned listed tyre company in the Shandong province of the People\u2019s Republic and chair of the tyre branch of the China Rubber Industry Association (CRIA).

I am writing you from Manresa, where I am with Bishop Fabre and my brother priests this week for our Presbyteral Convocation. For me, the past month has been very full but very rewarding. First, with Junior High Faith Experience, which was a huge success. I look forward to continuing to serve our middle schoolers. Additionally, March for Life and some college vocational formation and recruitment have been bearing great fruit. I am thankful to God to be able to share that we now have 6 young men in the application process for the seminary.\nAs I am now getting back from March for Life, I am grateful to share that I enter into a new chapter in the Diocese, as we have established the Office of Parish Support. The Office of Parish Support was officially established on January 1, 2018. Please see full list of the Office of Parish Support Team, that should help you understand their roles and how we can each serve you. To point out, the newest member of our team, we have hired Joe Klapatch as a Parish Liaison for the Office of Parish Support. Joe has recently moved here from Omaha, Nebraska with his wife Kristen. Joe\u2019s focus on the team will start with adult formation and eventually he\u2019ll transition to focus on Sacramental preparation and major life moments.\nAs you know, your pastor and parish implementation team is currently in the final lap of finalizing a tailored strategic plan for your parish. In the midst of this process, we recognize that more intense support with pastors and parish teams, including more support for you is our priority.\nAs a newly established office, still building our team, we would like to focus our resources on that which will help get your transition with youth formation off the ground. And, that which will bear long term fruit for the parishes. I know that we had hoped there to be a TEC retreat in February, as we weigh our all the needs within parishes, we feel that we would probably serve the parishes better by foregoing TEC for this year and committing these weeks to best empowering parishes in the process understanding the new vision, recruiting adults, and forming core teams.\nAs we approach Lent, there is a particular abundance of grace that is communicated during this holy time of the liturgical year. I would encourage a couple of things that can be effective in the absence of TEC for the next couple of months.\nFirstly, the most impactful style of ministry today for high school students is small group formation (as we have presented). I suggest to begin some sort small group study that will allow for their connection with each other and growth in faith. In particular, OREMUS (https://shop.ascensionpress.com/collections/oremus-a-guide-to-catholic-prayer) is a great resource that teaches the fundamentals of prayer.\nSecondly, Abbey Youth Festival is being hosted on March 23, 2019 at St Joseph Seminary College. It is a beautiful one day event that can serve the youth very well as an encounter moment. You can register your group here: http://www.abbeyyouthfest.com.\nThirdly, I would suggest having some sort of parish mission night or event around the pinnacle of our liturgical calendar, the Holy Triduum. I have known some groups to do youth Way of the Cross reenactments/plays, visit local parish Altars of Repose on Holy Thursday night, have a youth holy hour, host a youth Bible Study with the Easter Vigil readings, etc. If you need ideas or suggestions, we are here to help you.\nFourthly, Steubenville on the Bayou has registration open and active. You can register your group here: https://steubenvilleconferences.com/events/otb/#!/register.\nLastly, in April we will be communicating to you all about claiming your spots for teens to attend CLI. Throughout the month of April, parishes will be able to claim two spots per parish. (If all parishes claim their 2 spots, that will be 80 students and registration will be full. If not all are taken, then general registration will open on May 1 for any other students.) There are also some funds that are available to assist students who may find themselves unable to pay for the retreat, but I ask that the parish be the first in assisting and when not possible, we can then step in to help. More information will be coming in the next month.\nThank you for your patience with this process as we are learning what our parishes need. We will be in touch over the next few weeks as we plan to meet and further assist you in the planning process of our youth formation.", "version": "v0"}

It\u2019s called the \u201cBlack Country\u201d for a reason. Bad things happen there.\nWhen members of a prominent family disappear from a coal-mining village \u2013 and a human eyeball is discovered in a bird\u2019s nest \u2013 the local constable sends for help from Scotland Yard\u2019s new Murder Squad. Fresh off the grisly 1889 murders of The Yard, Inspector Walter Day and Sergeant Nevil Hammersmith respond, but they have no idea what they\u2019re about to get into. The villagers have intense, intertwined histories. Everybody bears a secret. Superstitions abound. And the village itself is slowly sinking into the mines beneath it.\nNot even the arrival of forensics pioneer Dr. Bernard Kingsley seems to help. In fact, the more the three of them investigate, the more they realize they may never be allowed to leave\u2026.\nI finished The Black Country over a week ago. I kind of wish I had written the review then instead of putting it off \u2019til now. It\u2019s not a book to think about. It\u2019s a book to go along with the flow and then put away when it\u2019s overs.\nDay and Hammersmith arrive in a small coal mining town where three people have disappeared, a father, mother and young child. The more the pair investigate, the more the town seems to be full of dark secrets. And there\u2019s the folktale of Rawhead and Bloody Bones, the local boogie man, who some seem to fear has gotten the family.\nIt\u2019s a good, atmospheric historical mystery. The town is sinking, literally, into the mines and the dark and dirt pervade the whole story. The townspeople believe in omens and sign and they almost make you believe too. The two detectives are clearly out of their element, but are determined to find the missing people, alive or dead. As I was listening I got sucked into the story, wondered where it was going next, what exactly were the secrets people were hiding. And I do like Day and Hammersmith. They are truly good guys, and intelligent. Kinglsey didn\u2019t get featured much here, although his observations help lead to the solution.\nThe problem is, upon reflection, there is just too much going on. There\u2019s the missing family and a plague that seems to have struck the village, with nigh on 70% of the village ill, then you\u2019ve got another out-of -towner who is being pursued by a disfigured man because of something that happened during America\u2019s Civil War, along with interludes from that time. The vicar\u2019s wife has a secret she tries to tell Day but is too vague. There\u2019s a blizzard. Hammersmith gets poisoned and comes down ill but still manages to be useful. Day\u2019s pregnant wife stops by for half a day. Then the local constable disappears, but no one seems to actually notice. And the buildings are sinking, sometimes quicker than others. And there\u2019s a baby bird and a pig\u2019s eye. The end is a mish-mash of everything all at once, confessions, revelations, snow, fire, guns, Rawhead and Bloody Bones. Too convenient and yet too absurd at the same time. But when I was listening, it didn\u2019t strike me that way.\nI\u2019m not usually one to read books with kids as characters. I\u2019m not sure why exactly, but there it is. Here, however, the kids are interesting or disturbing, mostly disturbing.\nThe narrator did a good job. There were a lot of characters but he made them all distinct. Also, I think he is part of why you could get lost in the story without feeling like it was melodramatic; he maintained control, made it all seem reasonable somehow.\nIt\u2019s enjoyable, fast-paced although with perhaps too many strings. But maybe real life can be a little like that sometimes. If my house were going to catch on fire, it probably would be the same day I lost my job or my car broke down, you know. Unrelated but all happening at once.\nI read the first book in the series and I am not sure whether I want to continue it. This is a good review, gives me a lot of information.\nI\u2019m probably not focused enough to read a book like that right now.\nLooks like it has potential.\nWe\u2019re going to visit the Black Country area of England because my husband is interested in the Industrial Revolution, so I might like this just for the setting. This would be a good post for British Isles Friday on my blog.", "version": "v0"}

Although it was a short visit, we felt like we did so much. Other than depicted below, the highlights included visiting the neighbours kids for trampoline and zip line fun; walking to the community park \u2018on their own\u2019; seeing their first black bear while on the highway to Margaree; making seaglass art for Mothers Day; and visiting Grandpa at the store.\nOn the last point, both girls were cute to immediately assume their working roles behind the counter. This was especially neat for them as Grandpa is in the final stages the sale of the Brook Village Grocery. The new owners are to start at the end of June and we may be seeing more of Grandpa starting in July!\nThe photo of the concert was taken at the Inverary Manor in Inverness. Mom and an aunt and uncle were among those who sang Beatles tunes on Sunday afternoon. It was an excellent renewal of the old songs!\nThe girls ran for their lives on a 5k zombie Run in Fredericton called \u2018The Running Dead\u201d. They had a task of outrunning well dressed foes trying to grab their ribbons from their waist bands. Rebecca quickly made friends and took off running with them, leaving Abby and Sheena to face the zombies on their own.\nIt was Abby\u2019s 8th Birthday in October. She is growing up quick before our eyes. She has a smart new addition to herself with her new glasses.\nRebecca always seems to find a stick and something to hang from it whenever they are out for walks. This time, they are headed for piles and piles of leaves!\nOur family has been looking forward to trip planned to Grand Manan Island, in the Bay of Fundy. Grand Manan lies south of the mainland, across from Maine. The island is part of a archipelago which was debated over sovereignty in the early 1800s-1900s. (One island south of Grand Manan, Machias Seal Island, is still contested between the US and Canada.) Also, it may be a presumptive statement, but it seems that Grand Manan is easily overlooked when talking about Southern New Brunswick. Interestingly, there are friends of ours who have lived in the Saint John area, but never been to Grand Manan \u2014 a short 30 minute drive and 1.5 hr ferry to the island. I had been to Grand Manan as a kid, but remembered little of the visit. Although, based on what we saw after a three day camping trip there, we found it to be a little jewel of the Bay of Fundy with incredible scenery including 11 beaches, many lighthouses, bird life, and an island filled with a proud and friendly people with an easy going and welcome slower lifestyle. (We spoke to a few locals and heard there are older folks on Grand Manan that have never left the island!) I'd encourage anyone to read a bit on the history of Grand Manan, which gives a feel for the type of place you're visiting. Many authors and artists have called Grand Manan home. If you visit, be sure to see the museum, which is well worth the entry fee.\nThe first experience is the Ferry trip, leaving from Black's Harbour. It was Rebecca and Abby's first trip on a car ferry and just that experience was worthwhile for them. The added fun is watching all the sea life and islands along the hour and a half trip to North Head. Seeing whales for the first time was not lost on them at all \u2014 and it was fun watching their excitement.\nArriving at Grand Manan, we went straight to our campsite \u2014 another first for everyone camping together. The girls were excited to set up their tents \u2014 and more importantly their bikes to zip around the campground and explore their surroundings. We spent most of the three days thinking to ourselves that we will always bring the kid's bikes on these types of trips as any down time was spent biking. It gave them lots of freedom and little deserved breaks for the parents as well.\nWe headed straight for the beach next to the Anchorage Campground. The girls went straight to their beach play.\nAfter our supper, we left to see Grand Harbour beach and hunting for sea glass. Picturesque fishing and bait shacks could be seen on the road to the beach.\nWe also headed out to check out the Southwest Head lighthouse at the southern tip of the island. There are some distinctive rock formations off the coast here, which is also the starting point for the 3 day backpacking trip that can be done on the western coast of Grand Manan. From the cliffs, it was easy to see the US and the Atlantic Ocean. Machias Seal Island was also visible. Walking on the trails really felt like you might walk off the end of the earth!\nThe highlight of the evenings were the camp fires and evening biking at dusk. The girls could be heard laughing from the nearby playground with their glow stick bracelets.\nWe tried to spend as much time at the shore, even while waiting as there's shorelines all over on Grand Manan. (The photo above was behind a fish plant in Grand Harbour). The following day, we visited White Head Island \u2014 another inhabited island a 30 minute ferry ride from Grand Manan. The smaller island of White Head island has three beaches and lighthouses. This time, we visited Long Point lighthouse and the Sandy Cove area. To get the feel for it, imagine walking off into a sea of fog and following a gravel beach road switching from stone beaches to brown sandy beaches, with little or noone around. We found these scenic boats by the ferry to White Head island at Ingalls Head.\nThe grassy section of road leading to the sentinel lighthouse at Long Point. This was the grassiest area we could find!\nLooking back at the coastline from Long Point Lighthouse. Long since abandoned, the lighthouse rocks are full of sea birds, who's song was loud and clear.\nWe spent the better part of a day exploring White Head Island and the shoreline. A remote but beautiful spot \u2014 a beachcombers dream with all the flotsam and jetsam washing ashore.\nOur last day, we packed up early and spent our time in the North Head area, visiting Stanley's Beach, Whistle Point and the Swallow Tail lighthouse. Rebecca was wanting to take part in a rock skipping competition on Stanley's Beach, while taking a break from sea glass hunting. Both girls gave up some of their seaglass to other pickers, striking up conversations with people from the US and other parts of Canada.\nThe Swallowtail lighthouse is an iconic spot, likely photographed by most visitors to Grand Manan. A short hike to the lighthouse and the high rocks surrounding it allows a perfect view of the ocean and to do some whale watching if lucky. One guaranteed sight is the ferries going by to land at North Head.\nThe weather was perfect for our trip \u2014 we certainly lucked out while we were there. There was so much to do and too little time, making it necessary for another summer return trip.\nHalifax Trip: Bluenose Run, Friendly Meetings and a Birthday!\nHappy 9th Birthday to Rebecca! She was excited for this weekend for some time as she knew that she would get to visit with her cousins and run in the Bluenose Run along with her sister \u2014 in Halifax! Rebecca requested a homemade 'chicken fried rice' supper and was happy to have a 'somewhat' surprise cake with her cousins. She was grateful for the gifts received over the past few days as well and wanted to send a thank you to all! Our first evening was spent enjoying company and catching up with family.\nA large part of the experience of the Bluenose Run is enjoying it with thousands of others who also attended the race. For the kids races, they have it set up as a closed course \u2014 so the kids run with other kids sans parents (in some cases) and have a big finish at the Metro Centre. There they meet back with parents among a large crowd of other kids also meeting their parents. Needless to say, the organizers recommend finding your meeting spot in the Metro Centre prior to the race and going over the race plan with your kids at the same time. We were told that this year a record number of people attended the kids races, with 4000+ running at the same time. We laughed, because 4000+ could easily be 6000+ with parents in the mix. Here's an example of the starting area prior to the kids run.\nAbby started first and ran around the Halifax Citadel for her 2K run. Sheena met her at the finish line and had to try and get Abby's attention several times as she was running with such a determined and business like expression! Abby was proud of her accomplishment and her coveted blue nose.\nRebecca ran her 4K run around the Citadel and the Halifax Commons route. I tried to see her at the finish line, but there were so many people finishing that I obviously missed her at the line, seeing that she turned up at the meeting spot and Sheena found her first! She was also very happy about completing the race. It was one of their first races alone in such a large crowd.\nAfter a celebratory dinner and a well needed rest at home, I enjoyed a 'quiet' evening with Kris and Jean-Paul for a couple of board games.\nThe following day, we had plans to meet with friends for most of the day. One of the visits was with Matthew, Melissa and meet their 7 month old Millie. We met them at the new Halifax Central library and had our introductions before heading off for a walk to get lunch and a stroll through the Public Gardens. The girls really took to Millie and Millie was a delight to see laugh and smile at the attention.\nHere's Rebecca following Matt down Spring Garden Road.\nHere's a continuation of our summer photos! (See the first post here.) Above we see Rebecca playing with some of the chickens that Grampa sells at the store. He receives orders and a couple times a year distributes baby chicks for growing! Naturally, the girls love them.\nSporting the boogie board! They loved heading out into the water in the waves of Inverness Beach.\nBelow you see Sheena relaxing at one of the scenic points on the Cabot Trail, Cape Breton Highlands National Park. Her and her cousin Karen took a camping trip and explored the areas of northern Cape Breton. One of their hikes was to Fishing Cove, a popular destination for backpackers as well.\nSheena took this photo of the view from Jumping Mouse Campground, near Bay St. Lawrence and north of Cape North. Both her and Karen highly recommended this spot for camping outside the national park.\nOn one of the cooler wet days in Brook Village (where we couldn't go to the beach), we took the girls to the Louisbourg National Historic site in eastern Cape Breton. Fortress Louisbourg is a restoration of an 18th century French fortification. There are actors that portray roles in costume and really make it interesting for those visiting.\nHere's the entrance to the Fortress. Shortly before passing this gate, we were interrogated by the guard to make sure we weren't English subjects acting as spies or smuggling weapons.\nThe girls even had a chance to dress up in period costume. This particular house was for a lord, where servants kept up with the house work and cooking. It was neat to see how many layers of clothes they had to put on. Clothes had to be warm in the 18th century with the wind and storms of the Louisbourg area!\nLouisbourg residents even had animals that they had to tend to, including sheep. One of the residents let us feed the sheep some tasty weeds from a garden nearby.\nIt appeared that most visitors to Louisbourg visit the fortress itself, but what we found was there were beaches that were also part of the historic site. These seemed little visited and were absolutely beautiful. We walked the soft sand and explored for a while. Rebecca didn't seem to mind the frigid Atlantic water.\nA fun day exploring the fortress requires a jump for joy!\nWe decided to spend more time in Louisbourg and explore a lighthouse at another part of the historic site on the other side of the harbour. The lighthouse is built on the site of the oldest lighthouse in Canada. It was mesmerizing watching the power of the ocean hitting the rocks all around the coast. We also had near perfect evening light for our photos.\nHere is the Louisbourg Harbour lighthouse. This view is looking toward the fortress.\nAnother sunny day and we're back in Inverness Beach for boogie boarding in the waves. These girls spent nearly an hour and a half braving the cold water and riding the waves.\nBelow you see the girls lined up for another fun run in Inverness, during the Inverness Gathering Festival. This was quite the accomplishment for them. Both girls ran in a 1.5 k fun run, then ran and walked the 5 kilometre race following the fun run.\nHere's Rebecca running along the race track.\nAbby is keeping pace as well and almost finished!\nIt was also Sheena's first 5 km race. Here they all are after finishing the run! Abby is a proud little one after her accomplishment.\nHere's Rebecca finishing her 5 km run. She was signed up for the walk, but decided to run instead. She ran with the adults and teenage kids. Needless to say, they had a fun and complete day of exercise and Grandma treated them to a breakfast at the Coal Miner's Cafe.\nIt was a busy day ahead for the girls as they were recruited to sit in the Legion truck for the festival parade. It was a first to be in a parade float and they were excited to get T-Shirts as well.\nWhat did everyone do with their beach treasures afterward? Well, Sheena helped out making seaglass art. This one below was made and designed entirely by Abby. The blue glass a rare glass find. The pots are made out of smooth pottery pieces also found on the beach.\nSheena made the above picture with seaglass and small pebbles also found on the beach. She really has a knack for this type of art.\nAfter arriving back home to New Brunswick, we had visitors from Virginia Beach. Sheena's friend Lauren drove to Belleisle and brought her three children as well. Sheena spent the days taking the group to local fun spots, including one of our favorite exploration beaches at Duck Pond Rd beach in Gardner Creek. The below photos show some of the rocks you can explore and a freshwater creek leading into the Bay of Fundy.\nHere's the gang gathered under our tree fort. They spent a few days at their 'restaurant' serving dirt coffee, sand cakes and chocolate mud desserts.\nI'm finally posting a few photos from this summer as we've had a busy one so far. With a colder spring, we had to get used to colder water for the earlier part of the summer. This however, did not stop the kids from putting on their bathing suits and jumping in. The above photo shows the kids playing in the Belleisle Bay with friends at their property along the shore. It was a beautiful night for campfires. The girls stayed up until 11pm those nights!\nWe also made our way to Cape Breton for some valued family time, which comes of course with beach time in Port Hood, Inverness and West Mabou. We spent much time between those three beaches in our time in Cape Breton. Sometimes two beaches a day!\nOn another day with the kids, we headed to Piper's Glen falls (Egypt Falls) in Scotsville. The girls were very excited to see such a big waterfall. Rebecca announced she was going into the water no matter what \u2014 and we all quickly found that it was probably only about 8 degrees! Again, this didn't stop them from heading in. Below is Abby heading into the cold cold water!\nOn another adventure with Gramma, we all ventured to Rocking Horse Ranch in Baddeck. It is a rescue farm for all sorts of animals: from ducks to horses to minature ponies. This one pictured below is 38 years old and quite the character. He kept trying to knock the bowl down so he could eat all he wanted. Abby loved taking him for a walk around the barn.\nThe girls were also given the chance to feed the horses with slices of hay. Rebecca really got into it and fed most of the horses in the barn.\nHere's Rebecca holding onto a little duckling. There were a few wandering around with the mama duck outside of the barn.\nWe had a wonderful visit from Sheena's cousin Karen while we were in Cape Breton. After Sheena and her returned from their highland adventure, we all took the girls on a hike in Cape Mabou. While I was somewhat forgetful on the length of the hike, we managed to all make the huge climb to the top of Beinn Bhiorach (Steep Mountain), the higher mountain the the area. We took many rest breaks, seen below and enjoying the views of the ocean.\nOf course, there was the well earned celebration upon reaching the top!\nDespite a chillier mid-July, we still wanted to get out and explore. We found some waterfalls to visit in the Glendale area. The falls were called Maple Brook Falls and had two nice areas for swimming and playing around. Rebecca and Abby did some of their first climbing around waterfalls in the two times we visited. In the picture below, the water is fairly chilly. Rebecca kept taking the cold water and splashing me with it. She's reaching down for more here.\nIt has also been a summer of firsts for the girls. Sheena has been an avid runner since last year and wanted to participate in some of the fun runs that happen during the local festivals in the communities around Cape Breton. The girls were also excited to try them out too. Here they are below doing a run in Port Hood as part of Chestico Days. Abby is happy to cross the finish line.\nGrammy participated too in the walk. All were happy to receive their medals for taking part.\nWe also spent many days at Inverness Beach. Inverness Beach is well known for its sea glass hunting. We would head down at low tide and walk the length of the beach looking for the rarest pieces of glass. There's nothing nicer than spending the morning walking the sand.\nAnother beach we frequented was Port Hood Beach. While there in early July, the girls made friends with Regan and made beach dates with her to meet up for beach fun. They spent quite a few days making sand castles, using the boogie boards and searching for hermit crabs.\nEver since doing the airport run in Saint John, Rebecca has been interested in running all sorts of different races. Sheena found that there was a kids triathlon in Port Hood mid July. So, Rebecca registered and tried it out. You can see her finishing her swimming below. We should note, that the water was below 15C and she was only one of 3 kids to actually brave the water for the swim portion!\nRebecca then took to the bike for the ride down the beach road.\nHere's a proud Gramma after Rebecca finished her first triathlon! We are all proud of her.\nSaint John Kids Fun Run \u2014 at the airport!", "version": "v0"}

It turns out being sensitive to the Force, the mystical energy field that lets you confuse stormtroopers and toss debris at newly-minted amputees, requires having a whole lot of midi-chlorians in your cells. Midi-chlorians are clearly a bastardization of mitochondria, the squiggly energy-generating jelly beans (er, organelles) found within cells of all organisms except bacteria and archaea.\nJust as midi-chlorians live inside cells and give fictional characters the ability to access the Force, real-world microbes can take up residence in the cells of larger organisms and gift them with cool abilities. For example, most plants are inhabited by fungi that help them deal with environmental stresses (e.g. drought, being eaten by herbivores) in return for food and shelter. These endophytes ('within plants') usually don't appreciably harm the plant, growing their filaments in the spaces between cells to minimize their impact.\nDichanthelium lanuginosum (commonly known as panic grass, which sounds like a really terrible variety of weed) is a species of grass found in Yellowstone and other geothermal regions of the western USA. Unlike the vast majority of plants, it's able to grow in warm soils that can reach up to 65\u00b0C on occasion.\nThe ability of this grass to tolerate high temperatures is due to its roots and leaves being colonized by a fungus called Curvularia protuberata (image of its filaments and candy corn-like spores). On their own, neither organism can withstand temperatures above 38\u00b0C, but together they become a potent heat-tolerating force.\nMaking things even more interesting, the fungus is itself host to a virus (a double-stranded RNA virus, to be precise). If you cure the fungus of the virus, fungus-colonized plants are unable to survive high temperatures. For this reason, it's been named the Curvularia thermal tolerance virus. It's possible to introduce the virus-infected fungus into other plants such as tomatoes, causing them to become heat tolerant!\nWhen temperatures rise, the virus causes the fungus to produce greater amounts of particular enzymes involved in making and breaking down molecules known to help plants survive water loss (e.g. trehalose). This suggests these molecules have an additional role in enabling the grass to deal with the effects of high temperatures.\nM\u00e1rquez LM, Redman RS, Rodriguez RJ, Roossinck MJ. 2007.

I was watching Argo this weekend, and sure enough, after all the diplomats were saved from Iran, Tony Mendez\u2014the hero played by Ben Affleck\u2014is notified he received an award from the President. Only he never actually gets the award, because, as his boss tells him in a parking lot, nobody can know about his mission.\nThen it hit me: That\u2019s the life of a content marketing ghostwriter.\nSure, you need to strip away all the danger and heroism and patriotism, but the function of doing a job without any recognition is identical.\nI haven\u2019t seen the marriage proposals, but the hate aimed at Westervelt was on full display. Most of it focused on why it\u2019s stupid to think about ghostwriting content in terms of morality, sentimentality, and pride. Check out some LinkedIn condescension from one writer. (Sample: \u201cIf you want to be an ink-stained wrench in a dying industry, knock yourself out.\u201d) Or catch up on some Twitter beef from Pando Editorial Director Paul Carr.\nHere we have both sides of the debate, and you can tell we\u2019re dealing in extremes, because there\u2019s a lot of cursing and insults flying around. Even Westervelt comments on how \u201cf*cked up the media is today,\u201d noting how publishers, desperate for content, are incentivized to take free ghostwritten articles from CEOs, while CEOs are incentivized to crank out ghostwritten content, and journalists are incentivized to take their money and write for them.\nAs journalists, should we write for big money and no credit? Little money and total credit? Or should we hold expensive seminars to teach CEOs how to write well?\nI don\u2019t know what the right answer is. But the wrong answer is to pretend there isn\u2019t a content marketing thought leadership problem.\nAs a freelance writer and an editor, I\u2019m always aware of the split between my \u201chonorable\u201d journalistic projects and the \u201cstrictly business\u201d content marketing projects. I empathize with Westervelt; making good money to ghostwrite articles for another company doesn\u2019t upset me, but there\u2019s something uneasy about the whole process when someone who didn\u2019t do the work gets the byline.\nNow that content marketing has been around long enough for trends to cement, we\u2019re getting close to a thought leadership bubble. Too much of it has become farce. The widespread publishing of ghostwritten posts from marketing leaders will continue to cheapen the impact that comes from the leaders who regularly put in the time and effort to pen their own insightful work. To me, that point seems inarguable.\nGoogle, in the spirit of keeping the Internet free of clutter, has echoed this idea by penalizing some guest blogging network in search rankings to prevent readers from accessing spammy content that all sounds the same.\nRight now, writers relying on income from ghostwriting thought leadership pieces only have two options: Take the money and learn to accept someone else taking credit for your work, or turn away from nice content marketing paychecks to chase bylined journalism. Clearly, there are strong feelings on both sides of the fence. The book industry seems to have found a fairly respectable solution when divvying up credit to leaders and ghostwriters by promoting popular figures on the covers with large fonts and the wordsmiths who actually write the books with smaller typeface. Would it be possible for publishers to do the same when running a ghostwritten article?\nIt\u2019s easy to understand why some of these ghostwriters, hidden in their apartments and co-working spaces, are upset about attribution and appreciation. The irony with the Argo analogy is people now know about Mendez\u2019s mission because of the movie. But it\u2019s Ben Affleck, the white male movie star, who gets most of the credit for someone else\u2019s story. As I\u2019m sure some would say, a thankless job nobody knows about is still better than no job at all, even if you never get a movie made about your accomplishments.", "version": "v0"}

Am J Occup Ther 2003;57(3):298-306. doi: 10.5014/ajot.57.3.298.\nOBJECTIVE. Elderly inner-city women (n = 125) greater than the age of 60 and living alone and who were consecutively admitted to a large, urban, university-based rehabilitation hospital were followed to (a) examine the power of standardized clinical measures to predict who was living alone 18 months after discharge, (b) determine whether live-alone women at 18 months\u2019 follow-up were more independent in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) than women who were not living alone, and (c) investigate whether women who return home to live alone and have low or declining physical function are at risk for subsequent relocation or death.\nMETHOD. Data from four standardized assessments (physical function, cognition, comorbidity, and depression) and demographic information were gathered during in-patient rehabilitation. Self-report IADL data were collected via telephone interviews at 3, 6, and 18 months\u2019 follow-up.\nRESULTS. Statistical analysis of results showed that physical function, cognition, and comorbidity were significant and independent predictors of living alone at 18 months\u2019 follow-up. Women living alone at 18 months reported significantly greater IADL independence than women who were not living alone. Path analysis confirmed that the relationship between the clinical measures and living situation at 18 months was mediated by self-reported IADL functioning.\nCONCLUSION. Standard clinical data obtained at discharge are useful to identify who can return home to live alone after rehabilitation, but in-home assessment of IADL remains key to understanding the complex skills required to live alone.", "version": "v0"}

The theme of this year's World Oceans Day is, \"Healthy Oceans, Healthy Planet.\" The world's oceans are indispensable to life on our planet and their value to the global economy exceeds $24 trillion.\nLife originated in our oceans billions of years ago and they cover 70 percent of our planet. Today they are repositories for a massive array of animal and plant species, and they are crucial sources of food, medicine and energy. At an even more fundamental level they regulate the climate and produce oxygen.\nIn addition to being the home of countless life forms our oceans offer extraordinary beauty. Sadly, due to pollution and climate change a wide range of species are under threat. The beluga, blue whales, orcas, walrus, sea lions and manta rays are just a few of many at-risk marine species whose protection is a focus of World Oceans day.\nAs reported in The Guardian, a recent report commissioned by the WWF suggests that the monetary value of the world's oceans is around $24 trillion (US). The annual value of good and services provided by the oceans has been pegged at 2.5 trillion. The report further states that things like climate change are subjecting marine ecosystems to unprecedented stress. This assessment includes fisheries, tourism, shipping lanes and coastal protection provided by corals and mangroves.\nThe reports lead author Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, indicated that it is critical for the business community to understand the value of the oceans and work to enact a strategy to support their health.\n\"If you don\u2019t look after an asset like the ocean it starts to degrade so it\u2019s important we start to solve these problems now on an international basis,\" he said. \"The oceans are in a bad state that is rapidly getting worse.\"\nClimate change and the resulting warming oceans are making life challenging for a number of species. It will take at least 10,000 years to reverse this trend so it is vital that we stop it before it gets any worse.\nAs explained by Hoegh-Guldberg, \"This generation of humans is defining the future of 300 generations of humans. We are conducting these experiments with our world despite the consequences for people.\"\nHoegh-Guldberg offered the following dire warning, \"if we don\u2019t get off the current CO2-rich pathway we\u2019re on now, all the attempts to control local factors won\u2019t work.\"\nThe report calls for eight key steps to revive the health of the oceans, including a stronger focus in UN agreements on oceans, deep cuts to emissions, at least 30 percent of marine areas to be protected by 2030.\nAs explained in the report, \"Without a healthy ocean, our future prosperity \u2013 indeed, life on Earth as we know it \u2013 is in jeopardy.\"", "version": "v0"}

The only way to stay focused is to surround yourself with persons of peace, who believe in Jesus Christ and prune those that are holding you back.\nMany people are fed up with the traditional church as we know it and seeking more meaningful to fulfill their spiritual fix.

We used to be able to make it happen quarterly, although as her practice has gotten busier and as her children have gotten older, it\u2019s more and more difficult to do. We last got together almost a year ago, and then had a flurry of rescheduling and canceling until we finally arrived at the following summer.\nOf the residents I trained with, she is one of the few still practicing traditional primary care. The rest of us have either hung it up entirely or moved into semi-related careers in urgent care, emergency medicine, sports medicine, aesthetic medicine, telemedicine, or clinical informatics. We were finally able to catch up this week and dish a bit about the healthcare landscape in our fair city.\nWe both initially worked for Big Health System, both in start-up practices in relatively underserved areas where the economics proved to be unsustainable. I felt a little guilty because she was a year behind me in training and I had recruited her to work in a practice situation that was similar to my own, and because neither of us could ever \u201cmake it\u201d given the economic model used by the health system. Typically, a newly employed physician is on a salary guarantee and is expected to break even in the first few years of practice. At the time, hiring hospitals were offering modified \u201ceat what you kill\u201d salary arrangements, which if you did the math academically using average reimbursement for the area, seemed very doable.\nDespite being more savvy than some of our peers, both of us wound up in the same trap as far as payer mix. As straight fee-for-service providers, we were negatively impacted when both local auto plants closed and many of our patients lost their jobs along with their well-paying insurance.\nI had already been forced to limit the number of Medicaid patients I saw after coming to the conclusion that having 30 percent of my panel leading to reimbursements of $24 per visit wasn\u2019t going to be economically sustainable. I did make exceptions for patients who were already established, but wasn\u2019t taking new Medicaid patients, which created a crisis of conscience for me as I was caught between economic realities (getting off that guarantee so I could start paying back my student loans) and caring for people as I thought I had been called to do.\nMy employer was ill-equipped to deal with self-pay patients, barely offering a discount and making it difficult to care for people who didn\u2019t have solid commercial insurance or Medicare. Although my visit numbers and my billings were great, my collections were terrible, and I was faced with a steep drop in salary at the end of my guarantee period.\nDigging into the finances revealed the fact that my employer was charging the costs of building my office against my practice\u2019s cost center, which although not specifically mentioned in the contract, was apparently allowable. Had I taken the easier route and joined an existing practice with no build-out required, I wouldn\u2019t have had any construction costs attributed to me and the cliff I was about to fall from would not have been quite as high. Fortunately, my colleague had gone into an existing space while her office was under construction, so she wasn\u2019t getting hit with the build-out costs and had time to maneuver before her guarantee ran out.\nMeanwhile, we were watching our friends who had gone out into affluent communities beat the guarantee in barely over a year since they had a stronger payer mix and fewer patients with public aid and bad debt.\nI was offered the opportunity to transition to clinical informatics, working a bit of urgent care on the side. She didn\u2019t have that option, so she terminated her contract and decided to take her chances with the non-compete clause and work urgent care while she looked for a full-time position. She was quickly snapped up by a rival health system, who offered her a position outside her non-compete radius and with a better compensation plan.\nHer new employer had realized that they weren\u2019t going to be able to recruit physicians into relatively underserved areas (her new position was rural) without finding a way to make the finances work. This organization used more of a RVU-based compensation model, where physicians were paid more equitably based on the work they did rather than by their payer mix. They also had more of their salaries attributable to quality scores. Looking back, they were much more on the forefront of pay for performance than we had been at Big Health System.\nFast forward more than a decade. She is still in the same practice, but coping with the ups and downs that many physicians do. First, there was the EHR conversion to Epic, which created a lot of upheaval and several years of slow progress while the system tried to synchronize content and features across a multi-state environment. Then, there was the birth of Meaningful Use and its respective pains and the rise of Patient-Centered Medical Home and other incentive programs, all of which put stresses on providers. She and her partners are trying to have a semblance of work-life balance when they\u2019re being asked to better engage patients by providing expanded evening and weekend hours, by delivering after-hours telemedicine services for their regional physician group, and ensuring their quality numbers are at the top of the scale.\nAt her age, she should be a good two decades from retirement, but she\u2019s seriously contemplating a change now. In addition to the challenges already mentioned, she cites her biggest struggles as low health literacy and socioeconomic issues \u2013 but the challenges are at two different ends of the spectrum.\nAt one end, there is the stereotypical situation where patients lack education about health-related issues and lack the means to address some basic needs. She has patients in her semi-rural community who struggle with food insecurity, transportation issues, lacking support systems, and more. At the other end are relatively affluent patients who have been streaming into the community to take advantage of inexpensive housing and who have much more economic means. However, they have similar levels of low health literacy, but due to insurance coverage and the perceived need for services, rank as \u201chigh utilizers of healthcare\u201d similar to their lower-status peers.\nShe finds the latter group more frustrating, as they seek care for many conditions that could be treated at home and with over-the-counter remedies. They tend to use urgent care and retail clinics for convenience, demand care within hours of having any kind of symptom, and often want tests performed when a history and physical would reveal the answers. She\u2019s tried to get many of them to use the after-hours nurse line rather than urgent care or the emergency department, but hasn\u2019t been successful, leading to increased work handling coordination and transition of care issues the next time these patients present to the office.\nWe talked a little bit about moral distress. With one group, she feels she is delivering poor care because they lack resources. With the other group, she perceives the care as poor quality because it\u2019s fragmented and sometimes the patients frankly receive too much care. It seems that dealing with these polar opposite situations adds stress of its own, with too few solutions in sight.\nFor a while, she entertained the idea of direct primary care or a retainer practice, where she could define the terms of care as part of the agreement, but was not willing to give up serving her less-economically advantaged patients. She\u2019s been having thoughts about trying to start some kind of educational foundation or organization that would specifically target health literacy and appropriate care issues, but it\u2019s hard to find seed money for something like that, especially when one of your constituencies is well off.\nWe talked a bit about the idea that \u201ctoo much care\u201d is relative, that as we empower patients, it\u2019s up to the patients to decide whether they\u2019re receiving too much (or not enough) care and to decide when, where, and how they want to engage with caregivers. It\u2019s a tough spot to be in, especially when you\u2019re trying to manage a business, raise a family, and control your own stress level.\nI didn\u2019t have any good advice for her other than to validate her feelings and talk about different approaches I\u2019ve seen in my travels. It\u2019s a shame that a physician with so much to offer feels like she is at a crossroads like this, with few choices when she still has a potentially long practice career ahead of her. The health systems in our community tend to suffer from shiny object syndrome, ranging their attention from telemedicine to school-based clinics to medical home to employer-based clinics to retail clinics and beyond. Neither of them seem to be acting very strategically, which adds to the madness of the system.\nWhat we\u2019ve arrived at is a two-tier system without admitting it. There\u2019s the \u201cpublic\u201d safety net system and the \u201cprivate\u201d alternative for those who can afford insurance. We pay lip service to quality and value-based care and the providers and other clinicians are caught in the middle somewhere.\nI\u2019d love to hear from people in progressive healthcare systems or delivery networks how they\u2019re addressing this and whether they can make it work, keeping all of the parties engaged and reasonably satisfied (at least enough to keep them at the table).

When we incarnate on Earth we forget our previous lives and connection to our souls and The Source. QHHT\u00ae enables all people from any background, culture, religion or belief system to engage with what she called The Subconscious, since it resides beyond the conscious mind. Dolores Cannon (the originator of QHHT) uses the term \u201cThe Subconscious\u201d \u2013 abbreviated to \u201cThe SC\u201d \u2013 to mean a greater part of ourselves that is always connected to The Source, or God, and has unlimited knowledge and an unlimited ability to heal the physical body. Sometimes mental and physical ailments are rooted in trauma from past lives; sometimes they are connected to lessons being learned in a person\u2019s present life. The SC reveals the cause and will assist according to any soul\u2019s particular lessons.\nDolores Cannon continued to work diligently on multiple books and projects including her QHHT\u00ae classes until she passed away at the age of 83 in October 2014. Her most recent book, The Search for Hidden Sacred Knowledge, was published posthumously in December 2014. Her next book, The Convoluted Universe: Book Five, was published in Summer 2015. Dolores Cannon\u2019s Level 1 QHHT\u00ae class, which features videos of Dolores, is available to take online currently in English, Spanish, Chinese and Russian. And Dolores\u2019s daughter Julia Cannon will continue the tradition of teaching Level 2 and the new Level 3 QHHT\u00ae classes in person in Arkansas and all over the world.\nI find this work very sacred and see a great joy of transformation of our clients. They are exploring their lives from the past to the present and to the future to open themselves to possibilities. It comes together where the client experiences all encompassing emotional, physicial and spiritual healing.\nThe session usually takes about 4 to 5 hours or even longer to complete. Please wear comfortable clothing because your body will relax deeply.\nYour session is a private, and confidential discussion between you and your practitioner, having someone else present during the session is not permitted, also may prevent a sufficiently deep trance thereby hindering a successful session.\nDon\u2019t drink alcoholic beverages , nor take the mind altering drugs 72 hours before, and on the day of your session. Eliminate or limit your use of caffeine on the day of your session. If you are a regular morning caffeine drinker, go easy and keep it to a minimum before your session.\nPlease eat well before you come in. As much as possible, clear your day for the session. The more relaxed, the better result you will have.\nThis is your opportunity to find understanding, healing, and a shifting of issues that may have puzzled you, or created blocks in your life. You may experience clarity, healing, and shifting instantaneously or see it in the hours, days, weeks ahead, with healing even continuing years after your session.\nWhen you arrive we will begin by relaxing, and getting to know each other, and I want to know what brought you to my door. After reviewing your list of questions, and making any last minute changes, I will get you settled comfortably laying on a bed ready for deep relaxation\u2026.\nAs I begin the relaxing induction you will see how easy, and natural hypnosis is, after all we are in the deepest levels of consciousness at least twice a day, when we wake, and when we go to sleep, simply relax and let the magic unfold!\nDuring the entire experience I will be right there with you asking questions to which you will reply. During every step of this process you will lead the way by telling me every detail that you are experiencing.\nAn important part of QHHT is when I speak with your Higher Self at this point, I ask your questions.\nBefore we end, I will bring you back to full wakefulness, feeling refreshed, and wonderful! You may feel as though you have remembered every detail, but soon find the memory is more like a dream becoming foggy and unclear. This is why you will receive a recording of your session, so you can listen it at home and review it at any time. By listening to your recording over and over again you will gain insights that you may not have noticed while in session. It has also been noted that those who listen to their recording often build on, and surpass the original (in session) healing.\nWe will have a short discussion on the information you received from the session, before you leave to begin your new life.\nPlease do remember that I am always interested in hearing from you in the future, and encourage you to continue communication with me, and let me know how the session has affected your life.\nOne session takes about 4-5 hours or even longer. To make your session prepared for success, please scroll down the page and find the section calls \u201cBefore and After the QHHT Session\u201d.\nFee for the session is $380.00 and session in person only.", "version": "v0"}

Kitchen Sink pizza, salad, pasta \u2014 we\u2019ve heard it before. But you know what? \u201cKitchen sink\u201d just doesn\u2019t conjure very appetizing images to me. I\u2019ll admit something\u2019s not right with my drain these days. It\u2019s probably clogged up with all those random foods I\u2019ve been tossing on pizzas.\nA crisper drawer full of food, on the other hand, is a much more inviting scene. And it\u2019s one that I\u2019ve been blessed with ever since joining a spring-to-autumn CSA. Even without the CSA stuff, it\u2019s home to many of my favorite things, fruits like concord grapes (summer\u2019s last) and cranberries (fall\u2019s first); then the cooking staples like lemons and limes, onions and scallions, and carrots (great for snacking, as well as building a stock). Magenta smears of beet decorate the crisper drawer door like graffiti, and its front panel is otherwise see-through, revealing layers of slightly squashed produce bags packed one atop the other like plates of the earth\u2019s crust on an archaeological dig. This drawer is just a goldmine. It\u2019s the first place I turn to when I want to cook, and in the case of this soup, it was nearly the last one, too, for drumming up ingredients.\nJust like the contents of a crisper drawer, there are hidden layers of vegetables within this soup, which take turns bobbing up to the surface the swirl of a spoon. Yellow, white and burgundy red carrots swim about, translucent strips of cabbage, celery and its flavorful, flat green leaves, a potato wedge, a green bean tube, and flashes of red pepper or mashed cherry tomatoes that manage to retain their bright hue. There\u2019s a whole world crammed inside this soup, some of the inhabitants of which can no longer be seen.\nYou\u2019ll want to add some ingredients much later than others, depending on your tolerance to sogginess. Green beans and and fresh corn I tend to add last, while dense leafy greens like collards get stewed from the start so that they\u2019ll get tender. My recipe below might be called minestrone, if it had pasta instead of potatoes, perhaps, or if it had beans other than black. Whatever it is, it\u2019s from what I had on hand. Happy soup-making, and hope yours turns out to be just as soothing.\nHeat a large, heavy-bottomed pot with the olive oil. Add the onions, carrot and celery and sweat for about 8 minutes over medium-low heat, until the onions turn translucent. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring, another couple minutes. Add the cabbage and cook until just translucent. Add the black beans, turnip, parmesan rind, bay leaves and stock. Bring just to a boil and simmer, covered, for about 30 minutes or until the beans are completely tender. Add the peppers, potatoes, green beans, corn and salt and pepper to taste. Let cook another 10-15 minutes, tasting for seasoning and adding anything else. Remove the bay leaves and parmesan rind before serving and top each bowl with a slick of the optional pesto.\nTwo brownie points: For a one-pot meal, it can\u2019t get much healthier than this. This soup has no meat, but it has plenty of protein thanks to the black beans, some green beans, and the vegetables, let\u2019s not forget, each carry a token offering for it in smaller portion (cabbage, in particular). Choosing potatoes for the \u201cstarch\u201d seemed a more harvest-y option, and although there may not be as much fiber than other options on that list (like barley), it\u2019s rich with potassium as a bonus. What else? For some reason, when I slurp up this soup, piping hot, I never get the urge to overeat, like I do with so many other good foods. This happens with soup for me a lot. Does it for you?\nEight brownie points: It\u2019s the last hurrah of the summer harvest, and a welcome start of the fall\u2019s, and this soup straddles both seasons in its ingredients \u2014 all locally sourced (except for the who-knows-when-I-made-that? seafood stock).\nI would never have thought to use cheese rinds in my soup, thats a great one!\nThanks for the template! I made my version this week and blogged about it today. Cheers!\nGavra I have already been looking at several of your own tales i could declare pretty good products. I am going to certainly book mark your site\u2026.\nI have been previously looking into a few of your current stories i may claim very good stuff.

From here, our guides have literally fished every brook, branch, stream, river and pond in Western North Carolina. There has even been one reported sighting of a DRO guide fishing in a mud puddle!\nOur Public water wade trips are available for any public stream in Western North Carolina. So you name the stream or ask your guide what has been fishing the best. Regardless of your skill level, you will enjoy a day with our guides.

We occasionally guide on the South Holston as well. The Tuckasegee River, also known as \u201cThe Tuck,\u201d offers great drift boat fishing from October through early June. The fishing will be a mix of dry fly, dry-dropper, and nymphing. Fall on the Tuckasegee offers spectacular scenery coupled with great fishing. The Watauga offers great year-round tailwater fishing. While you will catch some fish on small dries, or occasionally on terrestrials in the summer months, the majority of fishing will be done with small nymphs under a strike indicator. The South Holston offers great fishing year-round as well. However, the water generation schedule will determine whether you will be fishing tiny size 24 nymphs on a twelve-foot leader or casting large size 2/0 streamers on a sink-tip.\nRegardless of your skill level you will enjoy a day on the water with Davidson River Outfitters.

Not only that, but he met me at the car hire office at 8.15am so I wouldn\u2019t have to take a taxi from (a) to (b), explained all the dodgy weird things that had happened to the car and sent me off for a bit of a drive with Zeus to check it was all tickety-boo before I hit the road. He also said it was \u2018not a complete lemon\u2019 and drove very well.\nAlso, hooray to classic cover at the RAC snagging me a hire car!\nI posted details of my encounter with Paul and accompanying photo to a Facebook group called Rolling Solo for women travelling by themselves and it garnered more than 200 likes and countless positive comments. For two days of work, including a new water pump, thermostat, clutch fan, a few clamps and re-bolting the radiator back into the car (apparently it was holding on by a single thread) it was priced about 1/3rd the price Osborne Park Jeep charged me for a similar amount of work.\nI\u2019m glad I talked him up so much because I later met another couple who had been stranded in Port Hedland for a similar amount of time and Paul had been the only mechanic who had been (a) kind and (b) helpful. More about them later.\nBoth Paul and the tow truck driver regaled me with tales of what Port Hedland once was \u2013 something like 16,000 people have left the town since the mining slowdown, and countless thousands of shipping containers worth of stuff has been sent back to Perth. Vinnies ended up with so much donated stuff, it had to extend the property.\nAnd so, after six days enjoying the sights of Port Hedland (see Groundhod Day post), Zeus and I pointed the car South and hit road. Zeus was so happy to have his car back that without prompting he jumped straight in and climbed into his travel spot, much to the amusement of Paul.\nJarvo had mentioned a spot out of Newman called something that sounded like a pasta, suggesting it as an overnight stop. I hadn\u2019t thought much of it until about two hours out of Newman the campsite I had intended to stay at came up\u2026 And it turns out it was called the Albert Tognalini Rest Area, named after an engineer heavily involved in the design of the Newman-Port Hedland road. Brilliant minds, Jarvo!\nThis is just one small stretch of the highway which cuts through Manjuna Gorge, carefully engineered in the mid 80s to minimise environmental and cultural disruption. It would have to be one of the best kept secrets drive-wise in Australia, if not the world. Unlike many, I found the road trains no bother and actually very helpful \u2013 indicating when it was safe to take over, and generally driving courteously.\nAnyway, the Albert Tognalini rest area was huge and most it it looks out over the gorge, not the road, so after a bit of a stroll around we picked a spot and set up, then wandered around all the camp sites so Zeus could meet everyone, and thus not bark. This is actually quite a fun ritual because I also get to meet everyone and check out the view.\nI met these two adorable creatures, Jo and Michael. They were in a van travelling on the lead up to their one year wedding anniversary. Yes wedding. Like I said, adorable and in their early 20s.\nThey had bought an old van that had previously been used to move a wheelchair. This had two up-sides: it was wired for a second battery which could use to run the fridge, and surely a hydraulic chair lift would go for a motza second-hand.\nTurns out the former, yes but the latter\u2026 Not so much. They got $10 from a metal scrap yard. Not even enough for two decent roadhouse coffees (but enough for a bottomless pit of Nescaf\u00e9 Blend 43 at Auski).\nThey too had been stranded in Port Hedland when the starter motor on the van gave up the ghost and for love nor money could they find anyone to help them\u2026until they ran into Paul at AMS who helped them find a friendly auto-electrician to get them back on the road.\nPaul is also their hero. We discussed how to get him knighted or a sainthood or something.\nIt was around this time Tim arrived.\nTim is a local Aboriginal elder who each evening checks out the campground to have a yarn and teach some language and bush skills to whoever happened to be camping there. The previous evening he had met a family from Albany who were visiting Karijini and were parked up changing a tyre. I later discovered he gave them a leg of kangaroo to roast with strict instructions on how to do it, and a recipe, and took their youngest son on a bit of a 4WD tour down the gorge.\nHe\u2019s just that kind of guy. He even gets a mention in the wikicamps reviews.\nTim had no shortage of grief to give me about driving a Jeep \u2013 \u201cthis is Landcruiser country\u201d he said \u2013 created a stellar campfire with impressive speed and ease, and told us a few yarns about his work negotiating with BHP and FMG on native title and land use.\nThat said, it\u2019s also kinda awkward when someone shows up with the best part of a kangaroo carcass in the back of the ute and announces \u201cI just feel like listening to loud music and getting boozed\u201d so we weren\u2019t really sure how the night would progress.\nTim had also brought with him a shiny four-wheeler he was hoping to show the guys from Albany and see if the young bloke would like a run up the gorge tracks. Sadly, they had been out all day and didn\u2019t get back until after dark.\nTim left us after an hour or so of banter to content with what was now a roaring fire in roaring wind. Little scary.\nThe following morning Zeus and I took it slow, just taking a few photos of the gorge before we set out.\nWe had been planning to just head to Newman, but after lunch at the famed Purple Pub, it became evident the town was going to get loud on a. Grand final weekend so we made tracks and camped off the highway en route to Meekatharra, where I\u2019m writing this.\nI keep finding rocks I want to bring back for my garden. TC when I\u2019m back up this way, I\u2019m coming to visit with a big tub to collect rocks!\nMeeka is very much closed on a Sunday\u2026 We\u2019re at the only open servo in town and it\u2019s been a constant stream of people coming in. Zeus has delighted a great many kids, many speaking language and who have never seen a pug-like dog before.\nProbably going to head out to something called \u201cPeace Gorge\u201d to camp the night and head to Mount Magnet tomorrow, where apparently there\u2019s another indigenous art gallery.\nHave you come across old Ernie the dogger from Meeka?\nWhat a lovely message to get, thanks Sandra!!", "version": "v0"}

Although several institutions have matured quickly in their use of educational data, the field of learning analytics is still very young, and many colleges and universities are in the very early stages of the adoption process. The following definitions are designed to provide a helpful starting point into this field of research and practice.\nBig Data - Extremely large or complex data sets that may be analyzed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations which cannot be processed by traditional\u202fdata processing\u202fapplication software. Higher education, in particular, can generate rich data sets through Big Data. The challenge is to distill the data into useful information for the benefit of students, instructors, and institutions.\nData Democratization \u2013 The ability for information in digital formats to be accessible to everyone in a given organization, not just specialists or managers, so they may gather and analyze data by themselves.\u202fData warehouse solutions can support data democratization for educational institutions, enabling administrators, instructional designers, instructors, and students to align what happens in the classroom with the institution\u2019s retention or graduation goals.\nData Governance \u2013 The management of policies, systems, security, and practices, in order to ensure that an institution\u2019s data is accurate, complete, consistent, reliable, and available to the right people at the right time.\nData Science \u2013 A science that combines different statistical, computational and visualization methods in order to derive meaningful information from large data sets. Data Science is often applied to create predictions that other processes rely on, or to understand complex phenomena. Aside from education, it is also applied in fields such as finance, sports, biological sciences, public health, astronomy, and internet activity.\nDiscourse Analytics \u2013 Within the field of learning analytics, it typically includes processing discussions occurring in a virtual learning environment, such as discussion forums, chat rooms, blogs, and even wikis. It aims to capture meaningful data on student interactions to explore the properties of the language used.\nInternet of Things \u2013 A concept comprising the everyday objects that are connected to the internet and are able to collect and exchange data, relating to other devices and databases. Internet-connected objects contain sensors that can be used to collect data, and which increase the visibility of researchers into the teaching and learning process. Some examples of Internet of Things applications in education are mobile learning, smart lighting, and security systems on campuses and smart boards.\nLearning Analytics \u2013 Learning analytics uses data about students and their learning to help understand and improve educational processes, and to assist the learners themselves.11 It covers a range of methods that include machine learning, dashboard design, social network analysis, writing analytics, and natural language processing.\nMachine Learning \u2013 The science of getting computers to learn and act like humans do and improve their learning over time in an autonomous fashion, by feeding them data and information in the form of observations and real-world interaction.12 Predictive analytics is an example of machine learning application in education.\nNudging \u2013 It involves structuring an environment in such a way as to encourage a small set of behaviors, without also actively limiting an individual\u2019s ability to freely choose from a much wider range of options. In learning analytics, for example, it may mean providing students with information about how they are performing and alerting them in advance if they are at risk of not passing a course. It may also mean using activity data to understand and scale instructional design patterns that are likely to improve student course engagement.\nSelf-regulated Learning \u2013 A sense of personal responsibility for one\u2019s learning. When made available to students, learning analytics can provide them with the information needed to help raise awareness about their own learning. For example, benchmarking student activity against their peers can promote reflection about the relationship between performance and relative effort, and encourage students to adopt behaviors that are more likely to produce the desired result.\nSocial Network Analysis (SNA) \u2013 A procedure that allows the study of interactions and the strength of relations between individuals in a social network. In the field of learning analytics, social network analysis can help instructors and instructional designers to assess student engagement in discussion boards, as well as the impact that specific assignments may have on a network\u2019s shape. Using SNA to identify weak ties can also help identify students at risk of dropping out. When combined with writing analytics and natural language processing, SNA can help instructors understand individual learners\u2019 discussion forum activity, as well as critical thinking and originality of contributions.", "version": "v0"}

Photo: Alan Storer.\nPeterborough Phantoms\u2019 best season in years just continues to get better.\nDismissed by many as being an early-season flash in the pan and written-off by plenty of others as over-achievers, Phantoms are now two games from English Premier League play-offs trophy glory.\nSlava Koulikov\u2019s magnificent men booked their place in the finals for the first time in four seasons after leading from the opening minute until the final buzzer of their quarter-final triumph over Swindon at the weekend.\nA 4-3 road success in Wiltshire on Saturday (March 28) was followed by a 2-1 success on home ice last night (March 29) to complete a 6-4 aggregate triumph.\nThe crucial goal arrived with just under nine of the 120 minutes still to play as Marc Levers danced deep into Wildcats territory before guiding a sublime pass perfectly onto the stick of Edgars Bebris, who smashed the puck past Swindon netminder Stevie Lyle.\nPhantoms\u2019 reward is a semi-final clash against double-winners Telford on Saturday (April 4) lunchtime. Manchester and Milton Keynes will contest the other last-four clash after shocking higher-ranked sides Basingstoke and Guildford respectively at the quarter-final stage.\n\u201cIt was a very tough six periods over the last two nights,\u201d admitted Koulikov, who has reached the play-off finals for the first time in his short coaching career.\n\u201cThere were plenty of ups and downs, and changes of momentum along the way, but all that matters is that we came out on top.\n\u201cThe first and last periods of the weekend were our best and they were probably crucial. When we got the second goal on the night I knew in my head that we were going to make it.\n\u201cI felt in the second half of the second game that my guys wanted it more and that is another big reason in why we won.\n\u201cThey did a fine job to close the game out and I can\u2019t give them enough credit for the way they have performed \u2013 not just this weekend but throughout a long season.\n\u201cWe have earned the right to go to Coventry and it doesn\u2019t matter to me who we play. To be the best you have to beat the best and that is what we will need to do.\nPhantoms returned to home ice in the driving seat after a 4-3 Saturday success in Swindon and they quickly extended that advantage.\nLuke Ferrara made the breakthrough on the night when pouncing on a rebound after Wildcats netminder Stevie Lyle had spectacularly kept out Donatas Kumeliauskas during a powerplay.\nBut Swindon responded little more than seven minutes later on a numerical advantage of their own as Jonas Hoog bagged his second goal of the weekend.\nChances were at a premium in a nail-biting, nerve-jangling second session with both teams appearing fearful of making the mistake that might end their hopes of advancing to the finals.\nBut it was much more open in the final session as Swindon\u2019s need for a goal forced them onto the attack while Phantoms had plenty of joy on the break.\nLyle denied Darius Pliskauskas and Kumeliauskas before being powerless to prevent the city men from sealing their passage to Coventry as Bebris provided the finish that Levers\u2019 terrific work deserved.\nSwindon lacked imagination and ideas as they offered little in response and they were a beaten team when import wild man Tomas Kana was ejected in the closing stages.\nThe Czech bruiser, who had earlier sat out a 2+10 spell in the second period for an ugly check to the head on countryman Milan Baranyk, lost his cool with the officials after being called for holding.\nWith his angry stomp back to the visiting locker room went the Wildcats\u2019 hopes of salvaging the situation as Phantoms stood strong to finish the job.\nOther play-off quarter-final results: Telford beat Sheffield 11-3 on aggregate; Milton Keynes beat Guildford 7-5 on aggregate; Manchester beat Basingstoke 8-7 on aggregate.", "version": "v0"}

It is a precise combination of length, width and application. Alumaweld has been the leader in bottom vee innovation, delivering a broad offering of bottom styles to suit your specific requirements.\nStable, quick planing, with minimal bow rise, Alumaweld's 6\u00b0 shallow water vee is the shallowest bottom vee Alumaweld builds and is unique to the Super Vee and Free Drifter series and can be ordered as an option on the 21' and 23' Super Vee Pro. The ideal combination of a shallow water pad and bottom vee that's matched to engineered lifting and turning strakes, the 6\u00b0 shallow water vee provides predictable control that's perfect for free-drifting, back trolling, and trolling applications.\nVersatile, responsive, and sure, Alumaweld's 10\u00b0 shallow water vee is well suited to a broad spectrum of fishing and boating applications. Standard on 23' and 25' Super Vee Pro models, Alumaweld's 10\u00b0 shallow water vee planes effortlessly, is stable, and surprisingly comfortable in moderate chop. This bottom vee performs exceptionally well for back trolling, trolling, free drifting, and at anchor\u2026it is an ideal bottom vee for anglers that like to \"do it all\".\nUsed on the 16' Talon, 16' Sport Skiff & 20' Blackhawk, this full vee bottom works well with either outboard prop or outboard jet engines. The full vee configuration softens the ride substantially while providing a stable foundation that planes easily with limited horsepower.\nFor versatile performance, Alumaweld's Ride Master Vee incorporates the benefit of full vee ride with a shallow water pad that enables this bottom design to run through shallow water, tow a skier, carve through corners, and glide across open water. Available on the Columbia, Stryker Sport and the 18' and 20' Sport Skiff. This exciting new development in welded aluminum bottom vees has opened new vistas of performance to boaters that never miss a month on the water.\nOffered on Alumaweld's Stryker Sport series, 18'-20' Sport Skiff, and the 18' Talon; Alumaweld's 14\u00b0 full vee bottom is ideal for open water, prop drive applications. This ride-enhancing vee, tracks nicely for trolling and back trolling and carves through turns with little or no \"slip\".\nAlumaweld's deepest vee, this bottom configuration is used on the Formula Vee Outboard, Intruder Outboard models and Blackhawk 202. Designed for the demanding conditions of open water running, Alumaweld's 18\u00b0 full vee bottom slices through big water chop more effectively than any other bottom vee Alumaweld offers, with a ride that's luxurious yet sporty. The perfect combination of Performance Path\u2122 Lifting Strakes, bottom width, and engineered bottom design make this deep vee surprisingly nimble and quick for optimum running and fishing performance.\nFor open water use there's no better bottom vee than a full vee, that's why Alumaweld's developed 10\u00b0, 14\u00b0, and 18\u00b0 bottoms. A full vee bottom slices through the water, which makes for a smoother, softer ride. The more \"vee\" that's added to the bottom the softer the ride. Full vee bottoms cut through tight turns making them the surest handling bottom vee Alumaweld builds. In the case of Alumaweld's 10\u00b0 full vee bottom, a unique benefit of this bottom vee is that it can be rigged with either outboard jet or prop power.\nOften called a \"pad\", a long flat and true running surface is important in delivering a clean flow of water to an outboard jet. This pad, allows the boat to run easily through shallow riffles and rapids. Alumaweld builds two shallow water bottoms, the 6\u00b0 and 10\u00b0.\nThis exciting new bottom vee is a balanced combination of a full vee that runs nearly the entire length of the boat to a wide pad at the stern.

There are so many I could pick but this has been closest to my soul and played out the most perhaps.\nOur pal, Hector. He\u2019s made so much great music but I have to pick just one.\nProbably my most played instrumental track on a Tuesday. Some great tracks seem to skim over the crowd and pass them by but I feel with this, it has an impact every time. So simple and short and perfect.\nThe undisputed best Daft Punk Track. I\u2019ve played most of their back catalogue out over the years but this has long long been my favourite (tho Revolution 909 is v v v close and yes Homework is the better album) and gets mixed unashamedly over anything that even half goes.

It was a bill that would have forced collective bargaining on all Child Care Center directors and workers, including private and religious.\nTwo nights ago, Tom Emery, Executive Coordinator for the Washington Child Care Alliance (WCCA), and Executive Director of the Washington Association of the National Child Care Association (NCCA), learned from their legislative advocate, Cody Benson, that State Senators Steve Hobbs and Brian Hatfield decided to kill this bill in the Ways and Means Committee, where they serve as influential members. Losing these two votes caused the bill to die a timely death in this Committee, where bills typically find their resting place as \u201cdead letters.\u201d According to Ms. Benson, the SEIU lobbyists were quite surprised by this sudden outcome. Today, March 2, was the cutoff date for any bills to be heard or to emerge from Senate Committees. While the bill could be referenced in the budget battle, and thus brought to the Senate floor for a vote, this is not likely going to happen based on NRLA\u2019s experience at being at this stage of a bill-killing effort. It\u2019s remotely possible, but not likely. This was confirmed by Clark County (Vancouver, Wash.) District Senator Joseph Zarelli in a meeting with Ms. Benson.\nThat said, it is very likely that this bill will reemerge during Washington\u2019s long legislative session in 2011. The Northwest Religious Liberty Association (NRLA) will band together with Mr. Emery and the WCCA, as well as the Washington Federation of Independent Schools (WFIS), and others, in a marathon effort to continue to defeat this and similar bill efforts. One of the legislative tactics used by House and Senate members supportive of the SEIU\u2019s latest tactic of going after the private sector is to put forward multiple bills, which makes it harder for the opposition to defeat all of them during a given legislative session. We will need to watch and prepare for that in advance by shoring up our opposition support in both the House and Senate.\nRhonda Bolton, NRLA\u2019s administrative assistant, provided logistical support by scheduling face-to-face appointments for Greg Hamilton with every Washington Senator and their legislative staffs. Many of his appointments were 15-minutes apart with three buildings and numerous floor levels to navigate. Of the 49 State Senators, Greg Hamilton, President of the Northwest Religious Liberty Association (NRLA), met with 23 of them face-to-face, and the other 26 with chief legislative aides, during a week-long lobbying effort to defeat the bill in case it came up for a vote in the Senate. Admittedly, it was a \u201cJohnny come lately\u201d effort, since we did not initially understand the full import of the bill and its potential devastating consequences to denominationally owned and operated child care centers, such as Seventh-day Adventist and other denominationally based centers, including 501(c)3 faith-based, and non 501(c)3 faith-based, centers.\nMr. Hamilton was able to secure 10 solid \u201cNo\u201d votes out of 31 on the Democrat side of the aisle, and 15 \u201cNo\u201d votes out of 18 Republicans on the other side. 25 votes was barely enough to deter the bill from making it out of each respective Party\u2019s Caucus, which is the administrative level where bills are ultimately determined before they go to the Senate floor for an actual vote, even after they successfully emerge from the Committee or Committees that have held public hearings and voted to pass them on for a Senate floor vote. The bills then receive a third reading and then are officially scheduled for a vote on the Senate floor. In other words, another way of making sure a bill is successfully defeated is to work all the Senators offices to get firm \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d voting positions from them, both early on and during the later stages of the bill\u2019s progress. This also helps Senate Committee members in a given Committee to count heads and determine whether the bill is even \u201cwinnable.\u201d That can make a huge difference in attempting to defeat a bad bill that would damage the religious freedom rights of Washington\u2019s citizens.\nAs some of you know, the Northwest Religious Liberty Association represents the constitutional and workplace discrimination concerns of all people and institutions of faith in Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington. Therefore, NRLA\u2019s efforts to defeat this bill were in behalf of all private and religious child care centers with a religious mission\u2014the big guys and the little guys that needed our last minute assistance.\n1) Regardless of the voluntary opt-in language in the Striking amendments, it is not entirely clear which child care centers qualify for exemption and which do not.\na) The composite side-by-side graphical \u201cComparison of House Bill and Striking Amendment,\u201d as well as the bill itself, does not make this point clear. While owners or operators can choose to opt-in, the current Service Employees International Union\u2019s (SEIU\u2019s) qualification standard\u2014as traditionally applied and practiced over the last five years involving individual labor-union exemption requests by employees, and as confirmed in the Senate Bill Report\u2014is that only those child care center operator-owners who hold to a bona fide religious belief that discourages labor union membership qualify to not opt-in.\nb) In other words, because of the lack of qualification specifics, the House version of the bill, including the Striking amendments, appears (based on traditional SEIU qualification standards) to violate Federal Title VII law by limiting qualification to only owners and operators of one particular religious denomination\u2014those owned and operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church, whose policy encouragement statements are based on prophetic counsel and Scriptural mandates, and date back to the late 1800\u2019s. This leaves out all other 501(c)3 faith-based centers, as well as non 501(c)3 faith-based centers, from SEIU\u2019s qualification standard.\n2) There are no exemptions for individuals once 30% of regional owners choose to opt-in, in a given regional district. This represents the SEIU\u2019s attempt to use the state in a heavy-handed way to force the unionization of all child care centers throughout Washington State.\n3) Denominationally-based child care centers, whose mission purpose is not focused solely on delivering social services, could be negatively impacted and irreparably affected if the newly proposed competitive system for receiving annual Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) subsidies ended up favoring public over private and religious child care centers, as well as favoring private and religious child care centers that choose to opt-in over those that do not.\nThe way we read it the bill continues to imply that those who choose to not opt-in would violate the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cconstitutional conditions\u201d legal standard established in numerous rulings, which says, essentially, that any discriminatory affect evidenced by the systematic withdrawing of funding to an otherwise eligible faith-based services provider violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.\n4) This would negatively affect low-income families due to the fact that the state relies, to a considerable degree, on denominationally-based, and 501(c)3 faith-based, centers to provide needed services to disadvantaged families.\n5) Regardless of the voluntary opt-in language in the Striking amendments, this does not satisfy constitutional Free Exercise Clause standards originating in both the First Amendment of the U.S. and Washington State constitutions.\na) This is because it fails to insure religious institutional \u201cautonomy\u201d by the presumption that the price of choosing NOT to opt-in is monthly union membership dues, even if it is to a mutually agreed to charitable organization of their choice.\nb) In turn, this opens the door for the state, through the SEIU\u2019s direction, to place and enforce new \u201cdiscrimination\u201d standards for hiring and put in jeopardy the stated mission and purpose of private and religious child care centers.\nc) There are no compelling state reasons from a constitutional standpoint to warrant this potential outcome, not even the reasonable argument that the state needs to assert better oversight over all child care centers.\nd) The simple solution to this\u2014and the way to avoid the current legislative intent and thrust of this bill\u2014would be to follow Senator Paull Shin\u2019s suggestion which is to simply license all child care centers with an attached rating system like in Oregon and get the Unions completely out of any future bill proposal to improve child care. A child care center that followed the minimum required state standards would receive the minimum amount of state DSHS subsidies, including annual increases. In one aspect, the new system would be similar to state accreditation standards for other educational centers, and would model Oregon\u2019s system.\n6) State-mandated unionization of private enterprises as indicated in HB 1329 constitutes, under federal law, undue and disproportionate governmental regulation and control of private child care centers.\nBased on these arguments, the Northwest Religious Liberty Association (NRLA) urges you to re-evaluate the constitutional validity of this bill.\n1 Katter v. Ohio Employment Relations Board, 492 F.Supp.2d 851 (S.B. OH 2007). See also Wilson v. NLRB, 920 F.2d 1282 (6th Cir. 1990).

HB 1329 attempts to govern the protected conduct of religious institutions and nonprofits which oppose unionization for reasons judicially recognized as implicating their right to free exercise of religion. It is further constitutionally vague as it represents state usurpation of corporations\u201d free speech rights in the union certification process in accord with the Taft-Hartley Act of 1941. HB 1329 would be subject to federal pre-emption.", "version": "v0"}

We integrated our design consultants into Ann Lowengart Interiors' projects to provide support while observing and gathering data. At three months in, we took these data points and worked with the client to implement a \u201cblueprint\u201d of how a design firm functions at its most efficient and profitable, customizing processes the firm. At 6 months \u2013 and biannually going forward \u2013 this blueprint is evaluated and iterated to realign with the firm\u2019s growth objectives. Monthly billings quickly increased as processes were normalized and inefficiencies were eliminated.\nThe objective of the next stage was to diversify Ann Lowengart Interiors' pipeline and uplevel the target client, removing the barrier that the firm was the \u201cbest kept secret\u201d in the Bay Area design community. Ann Lowengart participated in the 2016 San Francisco Designer Showcase with metrics to break down this barrier: design a room that engaged visitors and the media, garner press features, sell pieces from the room and gain the interest of a new client.\nLeveraging the success of Showcase \u2013 and the awareness it brought to the firm \u2013 Coupar continued to hone business objectives. In parallel, the team focused on scaling the business to support the intake of new, elevated clients that came through key industry contacts: architects, builders and realtors as well as word-of-mouth referrals.

We feel better if we can help out by writing a check or volunteering for a few hours. If we\u2019re not too busy. If we\u2019re pretty sure there won\u2019t be a lot of drama involved. But who in their right mind would embrace the opportunity to help people in the midst of crisis \u2013 whenever and wherever \u2013 and do it every day? Perhaps someone who recognizes his gifts. Someone who sees God\u2019s calling for his life. Someone like Bob Barnes.\nBob is simply the best communicator I know. Leadership lessons. Bible studies. Commencement addresses. Just telling stories. He\u2019s also one of the funniest people on the planet. And he\u2019s a man on a mission.\n- Residential care to more than 130 middle school-aged boys and girls with behavioral and emotional issues.\nStaff members at Sheridan House hear stories that would break your heart. They see the products of miscommunication, neglect, and physical or emotional abuse. When they begin to work with people, progress is often slow, and not every relationship, family situation, or behavioral issue has a successful outcome. But it is worth the effort. Person by person. Day by day.\nI always wondered about social workers and grief counselors, and how they recharge their batteries. It takes a special person to deal with others in crisis, and often seeing people at their worst.\nHow do you leave it at work \u2013 and not take it home with you? How do you ensure that non-working hours are as stress-free as possible?\nIt is hard to identify Bob\u2019s \u201cnon-working\u201d time. Outside of his duties at Sheridan House, he teaches Bible studies two mornings a week at 6:30 a.m. and one evening a week at 7:00 p.m. He frequently does parenting and marriage seminars (with his wife Rosemary) around the country. And to round out the schedule, his Sundays are usually spent serving as interim Senior Pastor at churches in South Florida, when pastors have moved, retired, or been asked to leave. Over the last thirty years, he has been interim Pastor at nineteen different churches. Invariably these churches are dealing with the emotional loss of a leader, or are wrestling with uncertainty \u2013 and possibly discord \u2013 within the congregation.\nI sat in a Bible study one morning (yes, at 6:30 a.m.) several years ago, and Bob was just as insightful, lively and humorous as ever. At the end of the session, he asked for prayers for a local church that had been rocked by scandal. Bob later explained that he had just been installed as interim pastor there, and the previous night he presided over a meeting that gave the congregation the opportunity to ask questions\u2026and to vent. The meeting lasted long into the night.\nI think I responded with something really profound, like \u201cOh\u2026 Really?\u201d and I thought better him than me.\nOpportunities? I knew how I\u2019d react in Bob\u2019s shoes. Sleepless nights. Ulcers. Woe is me. You can bet I\u2019d either be unprepared or incapable of leading a study eight hours after the conclusion of the congregational meeting. Other activities would get shut down.\nAnd then it hit me. There was a recurring theme surrounding Bob and Sheridan House.\nWhen Bob was hired as President of Sheridan House in 1974, he accepted the role on one primary condition: he wouldn\u2019t be required to do any public speaking. He hated public speaking. But eventually, he forced himself to go out and speak. Teach. Preach. Train. Each opportunity allowed him to bring visibility to Sheridan House. Because the story needed to be told. He realized that pushing past his own discomfort could make a difference. For children. For families. For God\u2019s glory.\nSheridan House bought fifty-seven acres of land to build a campus that could become a prototype for equipping and supporting teens and single moms. At the outset of the project, it looked impossible \u2013 financially, politically, administratively. Why does someone with a ministry mindset get involved in negotiating a real estate deal, meet with engineers, subject himself to the political hot-potato of neighborhood activists and city politics? Why take on a project that large, and potentially that problematic? Because the needs are so great. For children. For families. For God\u2019s glory.\nSo here I was standing in a counseling center where the dysfunctional are welcomed, overlooking homes where troubled teens are given guidance and love, talking about a church congregations in crisis. I think if we were allowed to play God, we\u2019d all design our gifts to be something soft and passive, and we\u2019d be able to avoid anything messy. But thankfully, God is in control. I\u2019ve known Bob for almost twenty years, and he continues to allow himself to be stretched and challenged. Discomfort today may mean significant personal growth, and ultimately tremendous impact.\nAs far as Bob is concerned, the need in our country is great. The American family is at risk. Single moms shoulder a disproportionate burden, often without the skills or resources to be successful parents. Kids are growing up without role models, and they don\u2019t know what a healthy relationship looks or feels like. Couples go into relationships believing it\u2019s a crapshoot and they\u2019ve got a 50/50 chance of making it. Failure is not only acceptable, it\u2019s almost expected.\nSo for Bob and his associates, is it worth the personal discomfort? Is it worth getting messy? Sheridan House is one of the quintessential pay-it-forward ministries. As troubled teens, single moms, and fractured couples change their lives and their relationships, they begin to positively impact others. Bob tells stories of the graduates of the boys and girls homes becoming teachers, policemen, coaches \u2013 and even pastors. I\u2019ve personally met single moms who\u2019ve been equipped by Sheridan House, who have landed new jobs, received promotions, and in some cases, are now counseling other single mothers.\nThere is a sense of urgency about Bob Barnes. Some of it is a big-picture goal: to make sure we don\u2019t lose this generation, but get family, faith, and personal responsibility back on track. But the short term goal is just as urgent: to rescue the next troubled teen, equip the next single mom, help the next family in crisis.\nLife should not be about cruise control. It should be about impact. I think we all need to look in the mirror and be able to answer the question, \u201cWhy do you do what you do?\u201d I believe the answer for Bob Barnes is easy. For children. For families. For God\u2019s glory.\nThanks for your encouragement, Kathy. I can only hope that everyone has someone like Bob Barnes in their life. You are right about the introspection, too. When I interact with Bob I am always inspired, and at the same time, it causes me to examine how I spend my time and where my priorities are. The staff at Sheridan House is very selfless \u2013 and spending time there keeps me grounded. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re willing to get messy!", "version": "v0"}

But we did achieve a success rate of nearly 82 percent with all other award redemption efforts. Looking at the exact same research from two years ago, we found some improvements. We also found one program that has a major crisis on its hands, if we were to believe the actual results of our research \u2014 and we do. We\u2019re left wondering why no one else other than Consumer Reports and InsideFlyer ever bothers to conduct any research in this area (as we do monthly). When will some program do a better job at meeting the expectations of its members?\nSour grapes? Is that what award travel has become?\nIt sure seems that way. A recent WebFlyer poll of frequent flyers found that nine out of 10 feel that award seats are scarcer today than they were just two years ago.\nAnd the media is having a field day \u201cexposing\u201d the difficulty of redeeming your miles.\n\u201cThese plans have flown off course,\u201d reads one report. \u201cConsumers are steamed about hard-to-use miles,\u201d blares another.\nAt the same time, though, airlines are shelling out free seats in record numbers. In 2005, U.S. carriers handed over almost 16 million awards to frequent flyers \u2014 a 10.6 percent jump from the previous year. This number is only comparing corporate 10-Ks year-to-year. The actual number of awards issued by U.S. carriers was closer to 24 million awards issued since a growing number of awards come from partner participation not listed in these annual corporate reports. American AAdvantage had nearly 45 percent more awards redeemed on their partners than on American Airlines.\nAnd that\u2019s a troubling scenario since consistently on FlyerTalk.com members report having little or no problems getting the awards they want. There certainly are members who report \u201cnever getting anything,\u201d but it\u2019s no where near the 87.9 percent who say that awards are more difficult to get than two years ago.\nThere is absolutely no evidence that airlines have cut back on their award inventories. But there\u2019s plenty to suggest that the demand for those inventories has grown. For one thing, there are more ways to earn miles than ever before. In fact, flying ceased to be the primary means of earning miles two years ago, when credit card miles took the lead. And while that has throttled back a bit, these plastic miles continue to reign supreme.\nThose miles, after all, are a cash cow to financially strapped airlines. They sell their miles to hotels, restaurants, car-rental companies and credit card providers, and those companies in turn pass along the miles to customers. Those sold miles bring in nearly $4 billion a year.\nBut while airlines are doling out miles hand over fist, they\u2019re also cutting back on fleet size and routes. Delta, for example, has taken almost 8 million seats out of its domestic network since last summer, a 25 percent decline. But as we\u2019ve often pointed out, this really has not contributed to problems with award redemption in a major way, since Delta did add major domestic airline partners. The facts indicate that SkyMiles members have seen more than a 210 percent increase in total award seats than in 2000 and actually led all airlines in redemption numbers last year.\nAnd then there is that oft-forgotten fact that members compete for seats with paying passengers. With travel at all time records for capacity and load factor, some of the frustration today is simply related to the fact that any seat is available, whether the currency is miles or money.\nIn essence, the percentage of the pie dished out to frequent flyers hasn\u2019t changed \u2014 if anything, it\u2019s grown slightly. But the pie itself has gotten smaller. And there are more hungry diners in the kitchen.\nTwo years ago InsideFlyer released a study indicating that frequent flyers of the six legacy carriers \u2014 American, Continental, Delta, Northwest, United and US Airways \u2014 actually enjoyed a 77 percent success rate in booking \u201csaver\u201d award travel.\nWe tried to book two coach-class seats between each of seven randomly selected city pairs. Then we tried to book two business-class awards on an international route. We tried both online and through call centers, to see what differences, if any, there would be in available inventory.\nTo mix things up, we even checked our chances one week out, one month out, three months out, six months out, and 11 months out.\nAt the time, our overall success rate was about 77 percent. Delta SkyMiles came out on top, with a full 85.4 percent rate of success, and Continental OnePass crept in last, at only 54 percent.\nWe also found that despite some programs\u2019 claims to the contrary, your chances of getting the seat you want do in fact increase when you speak to real person, instead of booking online.\nWith 88 percent of you sensing that awards are more difficult to find now than they were in 2004, we decided to try our little experiment again.\nAnd things have gotten better, not worse.\nThat\u2019s right. The overall success rate for all programs combined actually rose from 77 percent to 82 percent. We got the saver seats we wanted 172 out of 210 times. Availability on Continental OnePass and Delta SkyMiles jumped 3 percent, and on US Airways, a full 11 percent. The other programs dropped just slightly, or held steady at the same rate as before.\nBut the picture isn\u2019t all rosy. Business-class awards on the international route dropped precipitously. Continental, United and US Airways weren\u2019t able to find even one. Only Northwest WorldPerks was even remotely respectable, with a 60-percent success rate. At least Continental stayed consistent \u2014 we could not find business class awards on this same route two years ago. The real disappointment was with United. Two years ago our research showed an ability to get this award 60 percent of the time, this time, not a single award was available. And American was not much better moving from a 60 percent availability to only a single award date available this year \u2014 10 percent.\nOne trend remained the same \u2014 members continue to have a slightly better success rate through the call center than online. Only Continental OnePass showed the same availability in both situations.\nOn a side note, while we applaud the apparent efficiency of the US Airways call center, we highly recommend that they be given a crash course in geography. Honolulu is in Hawaii. And Hawaii is a U.S. state.\nThe results are indeed surprising in the face of mounting dissatisfaction among members. But we didn\u2019t cheat. We didn\u2019t use any gimmicks or tricks, and we didn\u2019t pull rank. The numbers are what they are. Of course, we also looked for over 210 awards. That type of breadth is bound to yield a generally positive result. Were we just Joe Average, looking desperately for, say, a business-class award on United from Los Angeles to Hong Kong, we\u2019d join the critical chorus.\nTwo years ago when we produced our original research, we were encouraged to see that Consumer Reports followed a few months later with their own independent research, showing (within a few percentage points), the same results as we found. While we\u2019d like them to confirm any new research, we\u2019ve always been amazed that most if not all the general media, and even some of the specialists, continue to write of award redemption woes based upon no actual research. We find that this research can actually help our readers determine how their programs stack up \u2014 and as we all know, maybe it\u2019s time to change programs from time-to-time if you continue to have problems using your miles.\nIt\u2019s all a matter of perspective. Are there too many miles being earned by non-travel means? Maybe. But the mileage inflation argument is much less of a problem than some might imagine. Sure, miles are being added to overall circulation in vast quantities, but that isn\u2019t necessarily resulting in far greater numbers of people with high account balances. After all, the folks attracted to these offers are generally already frequent travelers. Ground-bound Jane isn\u2019t going to pick up a miles-earning pork gift basket online and suddenly transform into a wild-eyed mileage junkie.\nAnd if credit cards are generating too many miles, what\u2019s the alternative? You would be hard-pressed to find many frequent travelers in favor of ending these favorable financial relationships. Keep in mind that selling miles keeps programs and carriers in business.\nThe question then becomes: What can you do about it?\nFor starters, though it probably need not be said, plan ahead. The further in advance you make your plans, the more likely a seat will be available. And check out our results: Often, seats that weren\u2019t available 11 months out will open up at about three months out.\nCheck new routes. New routes offer a unique opportunity to award travelers \u2014 since they\u2019re new, there is very little chance that the allocated award seats have been used.\nUnderstand the big picture \u2014 the 25,000-mile domestic award is not the norm. It is a sales gimmick, and it comes with restrictions. The standard award \u2014 generally 40,000 miles \u2014 is, and always has been, exactly that: standard.\nAnd if Europe is your destination, try breaking the natural connection the booking engine will give you and see if any seats are available on the morning flights that a growing number of airlines are introducing. While it will often require an overnight in New York or other East Coast departure city, it sure beats the bottleneck that occurs now when everyone tries to connect on the evening flights, especially those living west of the East Coast.\nIf you have the miles, there really is no reason to think you can\u2019t go anywhere you please. Time and time again, our research confirms that the awards are out there. Use some strategy, and remember that one bad experience does not an industry indict. You may not get the grapes you were jumping for, but hey! What about those berries a little further down?", "version": "v0"}

This new legislation is known as the Congressional Integrity and Pension Forfeiture Act of 2011. The bill is an amendment to United States Code Title 5 for the purpose of denying retirement benefits accrued by an individual as a public official if such individual is convicted of certain offenses.\nIn the House press release Senator Kirk (R-IL), author of the Senate version of the bill, was quoted saying, \u201cAmerican taxpayers should not be on the hook for the pension benefits of convicted felons. The proposed legislation will expand regulations to include the solicitation of political contributions, tax evasion, obstruction of justice, theft or bribery related to programs receiving federal funds, interfering with commerce using threats or violence, or promising political appointments. The expansion will help block pension benefits for Members who fail to honor their pledge to defend the Constitution and uphold the laws of the United States.\u201d The Congressional Integrity and Pension Forfeiture Act of 2011 will reinforce current laws and protect tax payers. In a note on Facebook Senator Kirk said, \u201cAccording to the National Taxpayers Union, former Members of Congress who committed public corruption crimes are currently receiving more than $800,000 per year in taxpayer-funded pensions\u201d.\nWhen asked in an interview by Fox News about the fiscal note on the bill, Congressman Dold said that is wasn\u2019t so much about the financial aspect rather the integrity of public officials. \u201cIt sends a clear message about integrity. Your integrity determines your identity\u2026 It sends a clear message that we are very serious about integrity and how you conduct yourself not only while you are in Congress but also what you do outside of Congress\u201d. Although the bill will not stop current cases, like Former Governor Blagojevich, from receiving funding it will begin the path for a higher standard of ethics for our leaders. Later during the interview Dold re-emphasized the importance of our politicians\u2019 integrity, \u201cWe as public officials need to make sure that we are living by and meet a higher standard\u201d.\nIn a recent article by the Government Executive Rep. Mike Quigley (D-IL), co-author of the bill, said, \u201cA member of Congress convicted of defrauding the public doesn\u2019t deserve to retire on the public\u2019s dime. This bill makes sure that corruption comes with a lifetime of consequences.\u201d In the private sector, when you commit a felony at work you wouldn\u2019t expect them to continue paying your pension. Why should the public sector be any different? The American tax-payers do not need to pay federal taxes in order to pay for this sort of behavior. This bill promotes accountability throughout the federal government and should be widely received across party lines. These common sense consequences need to be put into place throughout local, state, and federal government. Should any tax dollars be going towards the funding of convicted politicians\u2019 pensions?", "version": "v0"}

Such a handsome, sweet boy.\nEli was 15 pounds 5 ounces at his 4 month well baby visit.\nHe wears 3-6 month clothing and Size 2 diapers.\nEli is still exclusively breastfed, eating 5-7 times a day. He has started to eat less times, but for longer periods.\nEli is still a great sleeper! He goes to bed around 9:30pm and wakes up between 6-7am, just like last month. He also takes great naps during the day (falling asleep around an hour and a half after the beginning of his last meal and sleeping anywhere from 30 min. to 2.5 hours). My boy loves to get his rest!\nEli has hit another big milestone this month....he is rolling over!!! The first time he rolled over he went from tummy to back (daddy and mommy were both lucky enough to witness it!), but since then he only has rolled from his back to stomach. He always rolls to the right. Must be his dominate side.\nWhen he started rolling it did mess up his sleeping a bit because as soon as I would put him in the crib he would roll over and get upset. Once he got used to it though, he didn't mind anymore. Every time I put him on his back to sleep he rolls over to his stomach and falls asleep.\nHere's Eli rolling over. He does it all the time, but it is hard to catch on video because he usually does it really fast and when you aren't looking.\nEli also went in the pool for the first time this month!\nHe seemed to like the water, but we had to take him out and hold him on a raft because it was too cold. He ended up falling asleep sitting up on the jaguar float. It was too cute.\nIt was also my first Mother's Day! Eli was tired and not looking too happy in our pictures, lol.

At one berth was the USS Gridley, a 510\u2019x66\u2019x31\u2019 Arleigh Burke-class missile destroyer, that arrived two weeks ago for work after transferring to her new homeport of Everett, Wash.\nNext over, the 382\u2019x73\u2019x18\u20196\u201d Washington ferry Kaleetan, in drydock for maintenance.

Communication is a fundamental element in life, and everyone requires having effective and quick methods. Thus, the light fidelity technology becomes vital since the idea helps to improve communication speed. Homeowners, companies and different organizations have embraced the light fidelity devices. Hence, businesses selling such gadgets can make a good money deal. It may not turn out as an easy task to open a store selling the speeding devices and conquer in the department. Thus, investors must get a master plan to aid in overcoming challenges or stiff competition. The paragraphs below cover tips for establishing a successful shop for LIFI products.\nThe position where the store gets situated can have an impact on the growth of a stall. Even though people are looking for the gadgets and demand is on the rising, investors should not expect customers in large numbers when the shop is located in interior areas where the population is low. Furthermore, when one rents an expensive room, the profits might be used on rent payment. Thus, one must consider the right position for the trade.\nTo run a business, or provide services to the community, one must get permission from the governing authorities. The same applies when establishing a store for LIFI devices. Investors should get a license from the county council or government. With the permit, one will not expect the authorities to bother customers or employed staffs.\nThe business of selling these products will require a substantial amount of capital. Therefore, one must find ways of collecting enough cash to invest. Since not everyone interested in such a business can have enough savings, finding a financial help is fundamental. As such, one should begin loan application on the early stages to avoid delay from the long processing activity of loans.\nPeace is a vital element when it comes to trade. As such, one must set a shop in areas where peace is not threatened. In case a region is experiencing war, no one will want to risk life only to buy a communication device. Besides, thieves and gangs can hinder customers from coming to the business.\nAdvertising the goods will help a store to familiarize the public with the products. Thus, when people learn the goods provided, they can visit the stall and buy. Therefore, one should find the right method of marketing and advertising. Social media, posters, and radio are cheap and effective.\nPeople struggle before they can get the capital, but one can lose it with a flash of an eye. Floods, hurricanes, and other natural calamities can wipe the investment within a few minutes. Hence, working on protective measures is expected before the establishment of a stall. One can find an insurance that is willing to cover any damage.\nDemand for the light fidelity merchandises is high. Folks seeking sectors to investors can utilize the chance. However, they must understand how to thrive in the departments.

This principle of international law allows us to set limits on free trade in cultural matters in international treaties.\nNational interest in our culture is beyond doubt due to the recent success of the movie \u201cIntouchables\u201d. Its producers can boast a box-office success with over 19 million admissions sold in France.\nMeanwhile, the film \u201cThe Artist\u201d was, without a doubt, less of a success in France, but it received international recognition and praise after winning the Best Actor Award inCannes and numerous Oscars including \u201cBest Film\u201d in Hollywood. This great success has brought back titles such as \u201cFrance wins\u201d which was used after France\u2019s victory in the 1998 World Cup.\nWhy is it that \u201cThe Artist,\u201d a film practically 100% French, has received this amount of success? The English title, the American and British actors, and the filming location of this French film succeed in demonstrating the balance between French and international touch that any export, product or service, must contain.\n\u201cThe Artist\u201d proves the success of a French enterprise that has sold its culture, radiating an aura beyond French borders. Will other French enterprises, like the young and dynamic company \u201cThe French Slip,\u201d seize this opportunity to recognize France\u2019s image when selling and exporting abroad?\nIt may be interesting to draw parallels withKorea and its export of cultural because it is also a follower of the cultural exception. It is a country proud of its film industry, with movies and actors repeatedly recognized on an international level. This dynamic, this know-how, this desire to export its culture, is further emphasized by the success of Korean TV series throughout Asia.\nThough it may be easy to speak about the export of French culture, it is more difficult to speak of the culture of the exports. The trade figures released by customs last February are explicit regarding the weak level of our exports when compared with the increase of our imports. Even if there is a general slowdown in exports (to the Eurozone in particular), due to the lower delivery of aircraft equipment in Asia and the tsunami in Japan, exports in some areas remain quite dynamic. This is the case in Germany; domestic demand is strong, especially in food products to Europe outside the European Union (Switzerlandwith art objects and Russia with jewelry) and especially the strong dynamism of exports to Africa, Algeriain particular.\nJohn Rauscher\u2019s book raises the issue of export culture in France. How does a country so loved and internationally recognized for its culture fail to use this as an advantage in economic success? What are the barriers that we impose on ourselves? Is this crisis a valid reason for the slowdown in our exports, or is it instead an opportunity to regain a prominent standing in international trade?", "version": "v0"}

At the very least, you might believe that it can't do you any good. The truth is, even if you refinance with a rate that's slightly higher than what you are currently paying, you may still save more than you would think by refinancing your home loan. Here are a few reasons why you should still consider refinancing your mortgage.\nSo, you're ready to buy a home in the near future, and you know your first step needs to be getting pre-approved for a mortgage. Whether you're planning on taking out a 10-year or 30-year mortgage, the fact remains that you still want to secure a mortgage with a great interest rate and favorable terms. By following just a few simple steps, you can ensure that you lock in the best possible mortgage rate.\nMost real estate agents feel a little helpless during the appraisal process. It is the job of the appraiser to figure out how much the home should be valued at. While an agent can use this number when placing the home on the market, the process of the appraisal doesn't require much from a real estate agent. Typically, a real estate agent may sit back during this time and wait for the appraisal to get done, but there are some things a real estate agent can help with during this time to make it go more smoothly.\nThe IRS allows businesses to deduct various expenses related to the cost of doing business and to lower the amount they might owe in taxes at the end of the fiscal year. One of those deductions concerns the costs of producing, or reselling, goods. The cost of goods sold can be deducted from your annual gross receipts to determine your gross profits (or loss). Here is how you can figure out the value of the costs of goods sold you have sold.\nAny home buyer can apply for FHA mortgage loans, as there is no limit on income to qualify. However, first-time home buyers and borrowers with low- to-moderate incomes are those who usually apply. Although FHA-approved lenders offer competitive interest rates and loan terms, borrowers don't always understand how the program actually works. Here are some things you need to know about FHA mortgages from the start: FHA insures loans. It doesn't make them.", "version": "v0"}

Also in charge of managing the development of new products. This included the mechanical engineering, styling, features, and what we would now call ergonomics.\nJim Lesurf (me!). The person who designed the electronics for the 700 range, and made various changes and improvements to the 600 range during its last few years in production. I had more hair then!\nCelia Hope. Celia was employed in the office at Armstrong, and she married Barrie during the 1970's.\nAlex Grant. Alex was a director of Armstrong for many years. He provided the main financial backing to continue the effort to produce the 700 range after the factory closed.\nIn effect, the people shown above were the team that developed the 700 range and brought it to market. As explained elsewhere, at the time the factory was in the process of being run down. However Barrie and Alex put a huge amount of time and effort into seeing that the 700 range was developed and marketed as they intended to carry on Armstrong as a UK audio manufacturer. At first I was employed full-time by the company to develop the new range. Then as the available money reduced I moved to a different job during the week. However at weekends I used to journey down to Barrie and Celia's home in East Grinstead where one of their back bedrooms was converted into a test and development lab. I then worked on the units during the weekend. Barrie then followed up this work during the week, supplemented with phone conversations with myself!\nAlan Farquharson. The managing director of Armstrong for many years.\nJeff Bonsor. One of the people responsible for production engineering and component purchasing, etc.\nKen Hart. Ken was the main person responsible for production. He was in charge of organising the production line and kept detailed records of production, technical and assembly modifications, etc. Alas, although very detailed records were kept at the time these have now all been lost so we can only estimate how many of each model were made, or what modifications were made to them during their production life. This photo shows Ken at the same 1970's factory Christmas party as some of the other photos on this page.\nTed Rule. Ted worked for Armstrong for many years and designed all their units from the later A-series up to an including the 600 range. This photo was taken of Ted around 2000, and shows him working his amateur radio equipment.\nGeorge Tillett. George designed models for Armstrong in the early 1950's and was responsible for the early A-series amplifiers. This photo shows him in the 1950's.\nUnknown to me, I'm afraid!\nRon Sheppard. During the 1940's Ron designed a number of models for Armstrong. Although he ceased development work he became the repository of all wisdom about past models and any faults or problems. During the 1970's he was in charge of all customer enquiries and his encyclopedic knowledge and friendly nature made him a superb ambassador for the company.\nJeff Bonsor. (See above.) After Armstrong shut down, Jeff went on to do a considerable amount of work promoting Christian broadcasting and communications.\nTom Budd. General handyman and fixer.\nJack Brown. Stores and goods inwards.\nCyril Page. For many years the chief test and repair engineer. When Cyril retired his job was taken over by Twaleb Jooman. Twaleb is now one of the owners of AHVS, the repair company which Armstrong evolved into when it ceased producing audio equipment.\nIn general, most of the key people worked at the company for decades. It is perhaps an interesting sign of how much people enjoyed working there that so many good people stayed there so long!", "version": "v0"}

Siebold, wife and daugther.\nFor two centuries the shogunates of Japan invoked sakoku\u2014isolation from foreign influence. Only a single point of contact with the West was allowed. This was intended for trade, exclusively with the Dutch. These \u2018red haired\u2019 traders were confined to Dejima, an artificial island abutting Nagasaki. It was to become the injection point for Western technology, science and medicine which, for over two hundred years, infused Japan with the knowledge and methods that would serve her well. After Commodore Perry\u2019s visit brought, through intimidation, an end to isolation, Japan leapt onto the stage of the modern world fully rehearsed and ready to play a role.\nThe Japanese were not passive recipients of instruction. It was they who learned Dutch, formed schools to teach Western knowledge and mastered advanced shipbuilding using little more than sketches of the Dutch techniques.\nChinese herbalism, moxibustion and acupuncture were prevalent in Japan. But their anatomy was primitive compared to the detailed knowledge of the Europeans. The anatomical studies of the inimitable German authority Johann Adam Kulmus\u2019s Anatomische Tabellen (1732), were soon conveyed in the form of a Dutch textbook Ontleedkundige Tafelen (1734). Japanese doctors enthusiastically conducted dissections to confirm what they were shown, and eventually a compilation in Japanese was published as The New Text on Anatomy (1774).\nRangaku was a collaborative phenomenon. Hanaoka\u2019s surgery under general anesthesia in 1804 combined a Japanese-derived anesthetic agent\u2014Mafutsusan\u2014about which little is known, with western operative techniques. Eventually, the baton was passed. In Osaka, on the trade route between Nagasaki and Edo (Tokyo), Ogata Koan founded Tekijuku, a Rangaku\u2013based school of medicine. From this were derived the programs at both Osaka and Keio Universities.\nThe Rangaku phenomenon was a long process, spanning from 1600 to 1868\u2014the Tokugawa period\u2014when members of this clan ruled from Edo Castle (Tokyo). The term Rangaku came to refer to the Western knowledge generally, not just the Dutch. Of four of the best known purveyors of medical Rangaku, three were German and one a Swede.\nCaspar Schamberger was a Leipzig-trained surgeon who signed up for a stint with the Dutch East India Company and arrived at Dejima in Nagasaki in 1649. He soon came to the attention of the Imperial commissioner Inoue Masashige, who had already embraced Western thought. Before long Schamberger acquired as patients a number of high ranking members of Japanese society . At the end of his two years in Japan, the governor of Nagasaki commanded a report on his methods which became the basis for the first Western practice of medicine in Japan known as Caspar-style-surgery, or kasuparu-ry\u00fb geka.\nEngelbert Kaempfer was also a German physician who came to Japan via duty as a ship\u2019s surgeon for the Dutch East India Company. He arrived in Japan in 1690, and stayed for two years, spending his time collecting local flora and learning acupuncture. Trees are alive today that were grown from Gingko seeds that he brought home. He also planted the idea in Europe that Japanese acupuncture was to be taken seriously, as he had seen cases of colic cured with needles. His travelogue of was immensely popular in Europe. It undoubtedly intrigued our next adventurer, who refreshed the genre 50 years later.\nThe Swedish botanist and physician Carl Peter Thunberg, a pupil of Linnaeus, was the only European who visited and published his observations of Tokugawa Japan in the eighteenth century.\nCarl Peter Thunberg was a Swede and an apostle of the great classifier Linnaeus. He himself was dubbed \u2018the Japanese Linnaeus\u2019. He too disembarked at Dejima, and was initially confined there. As head surgeon he persuaded interpreters to trade nuggets of knowledge\u2014Western medicine for Japanese botany. His entr\u00e9e into Nagasaki was the use of mercury to treat syphilis (known as the \u2018Dutch disease\u2019). In return, he was taught acupuncture. He left Japan in 1776, later to write Flora Japonica and Fauna Japonica, titles identical to later works that were based on the studies a another arrival at Dejima, one whose association with Japan became very personal.\nWe refer to Philipp Franz Balthasar von Siebold, physician, botanist and father of the first female physician in Japan. By the time Siebold arrived in 1823, the Dutch East India Company was out of business. Dejima was now operated by Holland. Within a year he had started a medical school, with instruction in Dutch. During the fourth year of his stay he fathered Kusumoto Ine, who became not only the first female physician in Japan but eventually court physician to the Empress.\nSiebold got into trouble with everyone. He was nearly recalled by the Dutch who had grown tired of his arrogance. He was put under house arrest by the Japanese as a possible spy for Russia when a secreted map of northern Japan and Korea was discovered in his possession. By the time he left, eight years in, he had collected over 1000 plants, kept in a private botanical garden. He secretly exported tea to Indonesia, Hydrangea to England and Knotweed (an invasive species) to America. Thirteen plants, two animals and a half-dozen museums bear his name.\nIt is said that Siebold was the first to acquaint the Japanese with the concept of vaccination for smallpox. But it was not until 1849 that the government of Nagasaki asked the Dutch to import cowpox virus, which was kept at the headquarters of the Dutch East India Company in Batavia (Jakarta). This they did, and the prospect of controlling smallpox with vaccination excited all but the Chinese physicians\u2014and the vehemently anti-Western Emperor Komei. The Emperor died from smallpox during an 1867 epidemic in Kyoto. His son however had been vaccinated ten years earlier, at the insistence of his maternal grandfather. He survived to become Emperor Meiji. The \u2018Meiji restoration\u2019 brought capitalism and industrialization to Japan. The role of Dejima as a portal of transformation was complete.\nSmallpox is now eradicated, with only two known lab stocks, one in the US and one in Russia. But the prospect of pirated smallpox as an agent of bio-terrorism is not being ignored. To this end safer vaccines have been sought, the most promising of which is the LC16m8 vaccine. It was developed in 1985 by a team of thirteen researchers at the National Institute of Infectious Disease\u2014in Tokyo.\nFour Japanese citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine: Sosumu Tonegawa 1987, Shiinya Yamnaka 2012, Satoshi Omura 2015, and Yoshinora Oshumi 2016. Eighteen Japanese scientists have won for Physics or Chemistry.\nYou can peruse history of medicine books through our Amazon affiliate link.\nVideo of Reynolds Historical Lecture by John Van Sant.", "version": "v0"}

Pitt landed a commitment from former Michigan tackle Nolan Ulizio on Sunday and Narduzzi is scheduled to travel to New Jersey to visit former Rutgers tight end Nakia Griffin-Stewart.\nIt\u2019s something of a double-edged sword, as Pitt has been both benefitted and been hurt by transfers in Narduzzi\u2019s tenure.\nA total of 13 players departed Pitt\u2019s team between the end of the 2017 season and the start of the 2018 season, a number that on its surface, seems alarming, though the players that left Pitt had varying degrees of success \u2014 almost all at a lower level \u2014 in 2018.\nThe Panthers got plenty of run out of Kent State grad transfer Stefano Millin at left tackle last season, and former Indiana wideout Taysir Mack figures to lead Pitt\u2019s receiver corps in 2019.\nThis season, the NCAA\u2019s transfer process has become even more streamlined, with the existence of the transfer portal preventing coaches from blocking transfers to certain schools. While that\u2019s made parts of Narduzzi\u2019s job easier \u2014 he\u2019s not necessarily a fan of it.\nPart of the issue, as Narduzzi sees it, is not so much the existence of the portal, than the sheer volume of players that have placed their name in it.\nThe other issue that Narduzzi sees is that a previous NCAA change has limited teams to signing 25 players per class in order to curb over-signing. If a team graduates 18 seniors, has 3-4 kids leave early for the NFL and then another 4-5 transfer out, that means they\u2019ll be playing shorthanded when training camps opens.\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s going to be the case for the Panthers this season. Pitt has just four players in the portal: wide receiver Darian Street, who is transferring to Towson, tight end Tyler Sear, walk-on kicker/holder Jake Scarton and walk-on quarterback Justin Sliwoski.\nNarduzzi said he gave Scarton his blessing to seek a transfer if he can find a place where would have an opportunity to kick instead of being stuck behind Pitt starter Alex Kessman for two more years, but that in general, he doesn\u2019t expect players that enter their names in the portal to return to his team.\nUPDATE: According to 247 Sports, walk-on Pitt fullback Jason Edwards has also entered his name into the portal. Edwards would have been part of a group of players looking to replace George Aston at fullback in 2019.", "version": "v0"}

This is a smart idea, regardless of your home situation. New homeowners and old homeowners alike should look to paint their garage. New homeowners should paint when they move in.

But, what if you need to learn how to clean garage walls before painting? Well, you are in luck. The Car Addict has all of the information that you need below!\nPainting is very easy on its own. You do not need to be a genius to paint your home. But, you do need to properly prep your garage. Always start with the floors even if you are not painting it. Cover the floor with a tarp or some type of mat. That way, paint does not get all over the floor. Unfortunately, paint is not easy to clean off of concrete floors. Thus, it is harder to clean off of vinyl and other types of flooring!\nNow, you need to take time to specifically clean the walls. If not, then the paint will only cover up the dirt, cobwebs, and other issues. As a result, the paint job looks really bad at the end of the day. Make sure you get the proper cleaning tools.

After all, sometimes the old color will cause a problem with the new!\nThis is a key step and it is the first step. Open every single garage window. Paint fumes and cleaning fumes are not good for your body. Therefore, proper ventilation is essential for good health and avoiding problems. Furthermore, we recommend using a big industrial fan if possible. This is also very helpful when it comes to drying paint as well!\nNow, you are obviously not going to need protection from head to doe. However, you do indeed need some help from safety gear. Buy some gloves, a painters mask, and even some goggles if necessary. Do not spare any expense when it comes to your overall safety. Also, remember to protect your garage floor! Put down that tarp and cover up the entire floor.\nGet a vacuum or a broom for this part of the job. Then, go around your garage and clean the walls. Get rid of dust and all spider webs. That way, you do not cover up these problems with paint. Dried paint cements these spiderwebs onto the wall. As a result, you should definitely remove them before you paint!\nPainters tape is a crucial and important tool. Use painters tape to avoid the overlapping of your new paint. You do not want to paint your ceiling nor your floor. Be sure to use this paints tape to your advantage!\nNow you know how to clean garage walls before painting.

This can be used by the insurance company to help prove liability. It can also be extremely important if someone ends up injured and files a personal injury lawsuit. The photos can help to prove why the accident occurred and who is liable. However, while most people know it is important to take photos after a car accident, they aren't really sure what they should be photographing. Here are a few of the things you should snap a picture of after a car accident.\nFollowing a car accident, it is important to take thorough pictures of both vehicles. When possible, get a picture of the vehicles in their resting position after the accident before they are moved. In addition to this, be sure to document any and all damage that is on the vehicles. The final resting picture and damage can be instrumental in showing who hit who or where the point of impact was.\nAs you take photos following a car accident, be sure to take pictures of the road. This may seem strange, but it helps to document any road conditions that may have been present that could have played a role in the accident. If the road was icy or slick, be sure to take pictures. Additionally, you want to capture any potholes or uneven pieces of road that may have affected driving conditions.\nWhen photographing road conditions, you may notice skid marks on the road. If you notice skid marks that were likely caused by the accident you were involved in, be sure to take pictures of them. The location and length of the skid marks can show the speed a person was traveling and when they potentially hit their brakes.\nLastly, be sure to take clear pictures of any other hazards that may have been present when the accident occurred. Was a stop sign hidden behind an overgrown tree? Was a street light blown out, making the road exceptionally dark? Take your camera and snap a picture. In some cases, a third party, such as the city, may be held responsible if they didn't maintain the roads, lights or signage. Taking a picture can help show why they may have some fault in the accident.\nTaking pictures after a car accident can be important if a personal injury claim needs to be filed. If you were injured in a car accident and the other party is responsible for the accident, be sure to consult with a personal injury lawyer. They can help you determine if you have a case and how to proceed with it. Contact an auto accident attorney to schedule a consultation today.", "version": "v0"}

The SAB Bauxite Operations business unit, a subsidiary of the SAB Mining Group, project managed all civil construction infrastructure and haul road development during the Civil Scope of Works phase in mid 2017, before going into Production in April 2018.\nThe contract involved the supply of a large fleet of heavy mobile plant and equipment and all land-based production mining activities including clearing, overburden and topsoil removal, the mining and haulage of bauxite (in accordance with the mine plan), operation of all ancillary equipment, screening and sizing of the ore material and the loading of barges via the barge loading facility; rehabilitation of the mined areas; maintenance of all mobile and fixed plant as well as providing the project engineering and supervision team including workforce planning and labour solutions for all operators and maintenance crews.\nRoughly 95km north of Weipa, the Bauxite Hills Mine Site Project is owned and operated by Metro Mining on a tenement package of 2505km square. This mine site has a life expectancy of 17 years, with the potential to extend the mine further into the future as a reliable source of bauxite. The Bauxite Hills Mine is expected to create 200 jobs when fully operational, including a 30% target for indigenous employees.\n\"SAB has performed admirably from a safety, indigenous engagement and productivity perspective\".\nThe Bauxite Hills mine site is located on the edge of Skardon River, North Western Cape York, approximately 95km north of Weipa, and is only accessible via chartered plane onto the sites private airstrip.\nThe tenement package of bauxite is 2595km square.\nThe mine has a life expectancy of 17 years with the potential to extend the mine further into the future, as it is deemed a reliable source of bauxite.\nSAB Bauxite Operations was contracted by Metro Mining Ltd to conduct the clearing, Strip mining, crushing and barge loading of the bauxite. This involved D7 and D9 dozers for the clearing, 988K Caterpillar Loaders and multi-combination B-Double side tipper road trains for transporting and 988K Caterpillar loaders for the Barge loading operations. SAB managed the overall running of all fixed and mobile plant machinery across the site, including the operations and maintenance of the Barge Loading Facility.\nSAB Bauxite Operations provided a workforce of up to 84 personnel including a total project management team and workforce for all operations, maintenance and HSET, Production Mining, Mine Services and Barge Loading Facility crew requirements. We achieved and maintained a loyal and committed Aboriginal and Torres Strait workforce of 47% throughout the course of our contract. We still remain committed to supporting their local sporting communities today.\nIn 2018 SAB supplied AUD12M of new Caterpillar plant (including 5x 988K Wheel Loaders, 1x 950M Wheel Loader, 2x 924K Wheel Loaders, 2x D7R Tracked Dozers and 5x D5K2 Tracked Dozers) plus semi water carts, body truck water carrier, graders, excavators and other plant to enable Metro Mining to build the roads, creek crossings, sediment dams, ROM (barge loading facility) and accommodation area extension.\nAs part of the partnership, the SAB Mining Group supplied all the mining and barge equipment at cost to assist with Metro Mining\u2019s start-up costs.\nAfter the successful civil program in late 2017 and the very successful mining start-up year in 2018, SAB Bauxite Operations achieved the ASX guidance of over 2MT mined, crushed and delivered onto the barges for the Bauxite Hills Mine at budgeted costs.\nMetro Mining has chosen to become owner operator and perform the mining and barge loading.

Featuring the work of twenty-two national and international organizations, including United Nations agencies, entities and funds, this is the first initiative of its kind organized in Jordan to shed light on protection services provided to survivors of violence.\nThe fair\u2019s slogan was \u201cSpeak up: Join your voice to mine to stop sexual harassment\u201d. The theme is aligned with the national campaign led by the Jordanian National Commission for Women (JNCW) and the Shama\u2019a Network, in collaboration with the United Nations. In addition to the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, Mr. Anders Pedersen, the opening ceremony included remarks by Dr. Salma Nims, Secretary General of JNCW, and Dr. Ibrahim Aqel, Director of Institute for Family Health.\nUNFPA and UNHCR, as co-chairs of the SGBV SWG, emphasized the importance of individuals\u2019 actions in creating change through joint awareness-raising efforts and by educating others on the existence of sexual harassment. The event advocated for the rights of survivors of violence, including amplifying their voices, mobilizing the general public against gender-based violence, holding perpetrators accountable, as well as ensuring access to specialized services and reporting mechanisms. The event also featured the testimony of a young Syrian refugee woman on her experience of empowerment and speaking up.\nOpen to the public, the fair was visited by more than 300 people and included booths showcasing participating organizations\u2019 work on gender-based violence, art activities, self-defense classes, theater, a video screening and a bazaar featuring food items and handicrafts made by local women\u2019s organizations. In addition to the public, guests included government stakeholders, donor agencies, and humanitarian and development actors.\nFrom 25 November, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, to 10 December, Human Rights Day, the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence Campaign is a time to galvanize action to end violence against women and girls. The 16 Days of Activism, under the leadership of the UN Secretary General, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the United Nations Secretary-General\u2019s UNiTE to End Violence against Women Campaign (UNiTE), calls for global action to increase awareness, galvanize advocacy efforts and share knowledge and innovations.\nThe Sexual and Gender-Based Violence Sub-Working Group (SGBV SWG) is a coordinating body with the objective to strengthen SGBV prevention and response in emergency settings. It works to facilitate multi-sector, inter-agency action aimed at prevention of SGBV, and to ensure a principled approach to the provision of accessible, prompt, confidential and appropriate services to survivors of SGBV. The SGBV SWG\u2019s focus is Syrian refugees in urban contexts, camps and other collective centers and also includes other populations affected by the emergency. The SGBV SWG develops and implements the SGBV strategy within the broader protection strategy for Jordan, and ensures, in coordination with the Community-Based Protection Working Group, the integration of SGBV in the multi-sector response. The SGBV SWG, co-led by UNFPA and UNHCR, coordinates with national coordination bodies and structures providing protection services under the Jordan Response Plan to the Syria crisis 2018-2020. It currently comprises more than 40 national and international organizations providing SGBV prevention and response services.", "version": "v0"}

Pre-made pizza dough is extremely delicious and, best of all, it\u2019s hassle-free and doesn\u2019t require any wait time for the dough to rise. Simply unroll, add toppings, roll back up and bake!\nYou can take this recipe and add your favorite toppings, like sausage, mushroom, olives, etc., but I kept it simple with classic pepperonis.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper. Lightly spray with cooking spray and sprinkle with flour.\nUnroll the pizza dough onto the baking sheet.\nUse a spoon to spread tomato sauce all over the dough, leaving approximately a 1-inch edge around the square. Sprinkle with shredded cheese and top with pepperonis or other desired toppings so they are all very close together.\nFrom one end of the dough, begin rolling it up, adjusting toppings as needed to keep the roll together. Once completely rolled up, position so that the seam is face-down.\nMelt the butter in a small bowl in the microwave and mix in garlic, salt, pepper and any other desired seasonings. Pour the butter mixture evenly over the top of the roll or brush on with a pastry brush.\nBake for about 10-15 minutes until the top is golden brown. A roll-up will take longer to bake than a traditional pizza.\nAllow the pizza roll-up to cool for about 5-10 minutes before using a sharp knife to cut into pieces for serving.\nPlus, try putting out small bowls of different dipping sauces for people to try, such as ranch or barbecue sauce. Just like a traditional pizza, everyone is sure to love this simple pizza roll-up with pepperonis or other toppings!", "version": "v0"}

The price of a slice increased to $5 on July 1, up from $4, the cost for the past year and a half. Just about everything else went up as well: Plain round pies are $25 and specialty square pies are $35.\nThere are those who have called Di Fara and left nasty messages on the answering machine, and there are those who have made a special trip to Midwood in recent days to find out what a $5 slice tastes like.\nAnd yet, the owner, Domenico DeMarco, 72, a founder, remains undisturbed by the commotion, cutting fresh basil over bubbling pies with a pair of kitchen scissors.\nThe price of a slice has long been one of the city\u2019s unofficial economic indicators, and the increase at Di Fara has led to intense analysis among New Yorkers about what, exactly, it indicates: a deepening recession, an easing of the recession, rising inflation, savvy marketing, price gouging, or commodity prices on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange? Or, simply, Mr. DeMarco \u2014 a bespectacled maverick of the New York pizza world, who insists on making every pie himself \u2014 being Mr. DeMarco.\nOf course, Mr. DeMarco believes his pizza is worth the money, and many of his customers believe so as well, arguing that in a city where rents, tolls and subway fares keep climbing, paying more for what many consider the best pizza in New York is entirely reasonable.\nMr. DeMarco uses imported ingredients. The flour, extra-virgin olive oil, San Marzano tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella cheese and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese are all brought from Italy, and the basil is from Israel.\nThe only person who makes a Di Fara pie is Mr. DeMarco, because, in his words, \u201cI believe only one guy should make the pizza.\u201d When Mr. DeMarco is not available to make the pizza, Di Fara shuts its doors, as it did for several weeks in January while Mr. DeMarco recovered from a car accident.\nMargaret Mieles, Mr. DeMarco\u2019s daughter and Di Fara\u2019s manager, said a number of factors went into the decision to raise prices. The shop has always used expensive imported ingredients, but in the past six months Mr. DeMarco has been more generous with them, part of what she called his new \u201cheavy hand.\u201d As a result, she said, more supplies are being ordered more often.\nThe increase in the city\u2019s sales tax was another reason Di Fara raised its prices, Mrs. Mieles said, since the tax is included in the price. (The tax rate goes up half a percentage point on Saturday.) She denied speculation that the price increase was to make up for a recent reduction in the pizzeria\u2019s hours of operation. It used to be closed on Mondays, but is now also closed Tuesdays. Her father wanted \u2014 and needed \u2014 the rest, she said.\nThose hoping the new prices are temporary, like those hoping the wait for a slice will get shorter, will be disappointed.\nAn article on July 31 about a price increase to $5 for a slice of pizza at Di Fara Pizza in Midwood, Brooklyn, misstated the age of Francesco Taormina, a manager at Rizzo\u2019s Fine Pizza in Astoria, Queens, who criticized the $5 slice. He is 22, not 42.", "version": "v0"}

Here's why that's changing.\n5 ways wireless connections will win Wired connections have historically been considered more reliable, but here are five reasons wireless will win in the future.\nFor seemingly ever the conventional wisdom has been that a wired connection would always be more reliable than a wireless one.\nThat may just be changing. ABI Research forecasts that the global wireless connectivity market \u2014 excluding cellular connectivity \u2014 will reach more than 10 billion annual IC shipments by 2021.\nAnd the protocols are starting to sound pretty compelling.\n1. Bluetooth. Certainly long in the tooth, but pervasive. Bluetooth will be in 60% of total devices by 2021. And Bluetooth Smart will be in 16% of devices by that time. Bluetooth Smart emphasizes power efficiency while the recently adopted Bluetooth 5 emphasizes range and speed.\n2. Wi-Fi. By 2021, Wi-Fi will be found in 47% of all devices, half of which will be smartphones. For high-speed wireless data transfer like networking, mobile devices, computing, and peripherals you've got 802.11ad, aka WiGig. For low-power Internet of Things devices and wireless sensor networks there's the sub-1GHz Wi-Fi HaLow aka 802.11ah.\n3. 802.15.4-based technologies like ZigBee and Thread. These are good for growth in energy management and smart city applications, like building automation, smart metering, smart lighting, and industrial applications. This will make up almost 9% of the market by 2021.\n4. NFC. Payments from smartphones and wearables will continue to take advantage of NFC and their growth may be slow but it's starting to look more sure.\n5. Combined multiprotocol System on Chips. No more will you have to choose which protocol to support or how you can stuff all the chips for all the protocols you need into an ever-shrinking form factor. Multiprotocol SoC will reduce complexity and cost, while future-proofing devices and getting them to market faster.\nSomeday plugging in a wire may feel as outdated as cranking a car to start it.", "version": "v0"}

You don't want the skin because it's mostly dead and doesn't have much DNA in it.\n2 - Put the chunks in a jar and mash the kiwi as much as you can. This is to break up some of the cells and provide a large surface area over which to extract the DNA.\n3 - Mix together the washing up liquid, the salt and the tap water and stir slowly until the salt has dissolved. Don't stir too fast or else you'll get lots of bubbles! This mixture is also known as an extraction buffer. The washing up liquid is a detergent and this breaks open the cell membranes and nuclear membranes. Once these membranes are broken, the DNA stored in the cells can escape. The dissolved salt (or sodium chloride) is made up of positively charged sodium ions and negatively charged chloride ions. DNA is also negatively charged and attracts the positively charged sodium ions. This neutralises the charge on the DNA, which allows the strands of DNA to stick together and form the clumps we will see later inthe experiment.\n4 - Add the extraction buffer to the mashed up kiwi and MASH! The more you mash, the more DNA you will get out at the end.\n5 - Incubate the kiwi and buffer mixture at 60 degrees Centigrade for 15 minutes. To make your own incubator, take a large basin and half fill it with boiling water from a kettle. To reduce the temperature, add about the same amount again of normal tap water. Using a thermometer will help you reach a more precise temperature. Carefully put the jar with the kiwi into the incubator and leave to stand for 15 minutes. Incubation helps to break up the cells further and starts to degrade some of the cell's proteins.\n6 - Remove the jar from the incubator and filter the kiwi mixture through a fine sieve or coffee filter paper into another jar. This removes all the unwanted lumps and bits of kiwi fruit. You should be left with a green liquid, and this contains the kiwi fruit DNA.\n7 - Take the ice cold alcohol and pour it slowly down the side of the jar. The alcohol will form a transparent layer on top of the kiwi mixture, as the alcohol is less dense.\nYou can use a paper clip or some tweezers to pick up the DNA. It will be long and stringy and clump together. DNA is a very long molecule and when it clumps together, it forms something a bit like a rope. This is safe to play with a poke at. The DNA you have extracted has come from billions of kiwi fruit cells, which is why you can see it so easily. If you were able to unravel the DNA in just one human cell and stretch it out, it would be two metres long. However as DNA is so thin, you would not be able to see it without an incredibly powerful microscope.\nIs dementia in your genes?\nTHE PROCEDURE BRINGS LIFE AND MOTIVATION TO SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY - THANKS.", "version": "v0"}

Originally released in 1995 as the first single from Daydream, the song broke a record on the American charts as it debuted straight at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, making Mariah the first ever female artist to achieve that feat. The famous music video, the first one to be directed by Mariah, was shot at the famous Rye Playland amusement park, and features clips of Mariah enjoying the park's historic wooden roller coasters. The remix, produced by Puff Daddy, surprised many when it featured the unconventional guest star \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rapper O.D.B. The remix became a huge success and yielded one of the most famous pop music phrases of the 90\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s: \u00e2\u20ac\u009dMe and Mariah, go back like babies with pacifiers\u00e2\u20ac\u009d.\nNathaniel M: This song is simply Mariah at her best. The incredible vocals and melody are only enhanced with the amazing intro. On top of these things, this song ranks #1 for me because of the memories it brings back. For my 10th birthday I got the Daydream cassette and a microphone- the only 2 things I asked for after watching the Daydream special on TV. \"Fantasy\" and the Daydream era always remind me of how many things Mariah's music has been with me through, and how amazing it has been being a fan through all these years.\nAlejandro P: In the club, in the car, in the shower, the ODB remix, the club remix, the original version, this jam just disconnects you from reality and every single cell of your body just wants to dance.\nEric W: This was really the song that started my love affair with music in general. I had always enjoyed music (and Mariah) before this, but something about this song infected me internally (in a good way) and just got me in the mood to appreciate great, upbeat songs like I never had before.\nJuan E: Who doesn't love this song. ODB takes an already amazing song to another level and it opened the doors to Pop-Hip-hop collaborations.\nMandy W: MC's best \"collabo\" in my opinion. She broke the mold with this song, breaking all musical barriers. She fought hard for this to happen, and the end result was pure musical genius.", "version": "v0"}

As soon as we get the paperwork we sign for it and it will be checked, we always pre-arrange with the client what they are going to be sending us, so we can check it to make sure it\u2019s exactly what they said they are sending, if not then we get in contact with them and check what\u2019s happened along the route. Once we\u2019ve checked it the paperwork is assigned to certain shelving, all these labelled up what it is. Depending on the client, we have some clients where the paperwork has to be done within the day and we have some where we have three or four weeks to have it turned around in. If it was a daily job then it would be checked straight in and a scanner operative would come out and get the paperwork and start on that straight away so we meet the SLA. SLA\u2019s are all different for whichever the client needs, whichever we set with them.\nGraham: Because we work from a specification form, don\u2019t we?\nKevin: Yes we do yeah, whichever the client would need we can do and if they ever need any paperwork in the meanwhile, we can come out, find it for them and we have a secure emailing system that we can scan into and email it over to them, so if they needed to check over any of the documents we can do that for them.\nHere we have some test paperwork that we can use to show you what we do after this. All jobs are slightly different but we generally have a prep process after we get the job and this demonstration is just simply taking the staples out, making sure all the paperwork is now non-stapled, the correct way round and ready to go on the scanner. I\u2019ll just do a few of these just for the demonstration. Yeah that\u2019ll be enough to show you how the scanner works.\nGraham: And we have got a variety of scanners Kevin that we can use?\nKevin: Yes we do, we have scanners, this is one of our main scanners, very versatile machine with ADF for fast type output and it also has a flatbed on it that will do up to A3 and that\u2019s for more delicate paperwork and stuff that won\u2019t go through the ADF. But we also have scanners that will do purely high volume paperwork that will do over 2,000 documents an hour and we also have a machine that will do up to A0 scanning, for plans and things like that.\nOn this machine I\u2019ll start the scan process, the ADF has taken the paperwork in and all we are looking for is image quality, making sure we have no lines and nothing disturbing the image and they\u2019re all very nice and neat and clear. If we do have anything with poor quality we have ability to create and setting or change the setting, depending on the paperwork to get the best image out of the paperwork. If we don\u2019t get the image we want and cannot improve the paperwork we always have a poor quality list with each job, depending on the client, sometimes we just provide the client with a list and we say this is the paperwork that we couldn\u2019t get any better than it is, other clients to their specification we will pull the paperwork out, keep it until the end of the job and then we will go through it with them, show them the sort of paperwork and why we couldn\u2019t improve it, but generally we can use the settings to get the best image we need.\nOnce we have scanned in, we then go to the indexing process and this can be as simple or as long as the client needs, depending on the information they need on the paperwork, for this demonstration we are just using a simple code up in the top corner and that will refer just to that one page and we can update and store that page. For other clients we will use a CSV file where we can put in a reference number they wanted, press return and it will bring up a list of whichever data they provide for that document.\nGraham: That\u2019s excellent, so we covered the poor quality and after scanning and indexing in then goes through to the QA procedures.\nKevin: It does yeah, which is all dealt with upstairs by a team of people and they will obviously check and re-check the paperwork before it gets processed on to disc or data transferred over to the client.\nGraham: Which is fine, so that\u2019s basically the scanning, indexing and paper prep stages and thank you very much indeed for taking us through that.\nKevin: That\u2019s alright and we would welcome you at any time you wanted to come down here and see the process in person, if you wanted.\nGraham: That\u2019s excellent, thanks for your time Kevin.", "version": "v0"}

BNEF predicts 37GW of small-scale solar PV \u2013 mostly on rooftops \u2013 and 33GW of battery storage will be installed by then.\n\u201cThis will be driven by the superior economics of these technologies, which will be able to supply consumers with electricity at a lower cost than the grid\u201d said Kobad Bhavnagri, the Australian head of Bloomberg New Energy Finance and co-author of the Australian chapter of the report.\nThe BNEF report follows predictions from the Australian Energy Market Operator, and even some of the main utilities, which follow along the same lines. Last week, AEMO forecasts suggested that rooftop solar capacity would overtake coal capacity by 2030 and that, within 10 years, rooftop solar would be providing 100 per cent of grid demand at certain times in South Australia.\nThe BNEF predictions for Australia are part of a global trend that will see energy systems move from centralised to decentralised grids, including in developing nations.\nSome $2.2 trillion is expected to be spent globally on small-scale solar, as capacity grows 17-fold to 1.8TW (that\u2019s 1.8 million megawatts). But nearly half of this ($US1 trillion) will be in developing economies, in many cases bringing electricity to remote villages for the first time.\nIndeed, solar and wind energy will dominate global installations out to 2040, with $US3.7 trillion spent on solar (mixed between large and small-scale) as the cost of solar technology halves again. The forecasts above are based on no further subsidies after 2018, be that feed-in tariffs or net energy metering \u2013 from 2018, except for offshore wind, which will see subsidies end from 2030.\nHowever, despite this boost in renewables, there will still be too much fossil fuel capacity remaining in the system, meaning that climate goals will not be met.\nPart of the problem is that the high cost of gas means that gas-fired power stations will likely close before coal plants, meaning that the great \u201cgas transition\u201d will not occur. This is one reason why Big Oil recently called for a substantial global carbon price to help push out coal generation. The one exception might be the US, where gas is cheaper and the government has strict emission limits on coal generators.\nIn Australia, the grid faces similar problems. Just over 29GW of fossil-fuel plants will be retired by 2040, including some 12GW of coal capacity, but 8GW is refurbished to prolong its operational life.\nBut Bhavnagri said any new large-scale capacity in Australia would be almost exclusively renewable. He predicts large-scale solar PV (currently little more than 130MW) will reach 15,000MW, overtaking wind energy (now 3,500MW) which will be 13,000MW.\nBNEF says these future large-scale solar projects will be lower in cost than building new coal or gas generators, even without subsidies.\nCoupled with the relentless growth in rooftop PV, this will mean over half of Australia\u2019s power capacity, and 59 per cent of generation, will be renewable by 2040. The grid will be kept stable by large amounts of flexible capacity, which includes at least 33GW of battery storage \u2013 also more than Australia\u2019s current coal-fired fleet.\n\u201cThis will require sophisticated market mechanisms to be developed to enable the system to effectively utilise these assets\u201d, Hugh Bromley, BNEF\u2019s specialist in distributed energy, said.\nDespite the change in makeup, Australia\u2019s power sector will not decarbonise substantially until 2036. The low cost and long life of coal generation will mean power sector emissions fall by only 9 per cent by 2030, compared to 2014.\n\u201cIt is not until 2040, when the bulk of fossil-fuel retirements have taken place, that power sector emissions substantially fall,\u201d Bhavnagri said.", "version": "v0"}

HGRF1-29 is a naturally occurring peptide that is actually a truncated form of a larger peptide that binds to the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R) and causes the release of growth hormone. CJC-1295 has four amino acids substituted in its chain that result in strong binding to serum albumin and prolong its half-life in the body. A single subcutaneous (sc) injection results in measurable quantities of CJC-1295 in the blood for up to 13 days. Additionally, a single dose of 60 ug/kg of CJC-1295 results in elevated levels of growth hormone (125%) while the pulsatile secretion of GH is maintained. Furthermore, 60 ug/kg of CJC-1295 elevated IGF-1 levels to the upper limit of normal. A dose of 30 ug/kg of CJC-1295 given weekly maintained its response with no evidence of desensitization.\nCJC-1295 is available on the black market and is currently being utilized by bodybuilders. A dose of 30 ug/kg equates to 3 mg per week for a 100 kg (220 lb) man and of course this would be doubled for a dose of 60 ug/kg. At these doses it may be cost prohibitive. Some are injecting CJC-1295 daily or even multiple times per day. There may be a danger of desensitization with frequent dosing. Many report seeing little gain with CJC-1295. This may be due to the fact that increasing plasma IGF-1 does not necessarily correlate with increased muscle mass due to changes in IGF binding proteins that may reduce the muscle-building activity of IGF-1. The \u201clack\u201d of gains may also be due to users expecting AAS-like gains.

If you haven't changed the plugs or wires on the car, that may need to be done too. The injectors may need cleaning as well. I'm not sure how you would go about checking the catalytic converter on that car though.

Weights not included.\nAccommodates up to 100 lbs. heavybag.\nSize: 84\" H x 48\" W x 40\" D.\nI'm very new at this and got my first punching bag on a Black Friday sale. I couldn't hang it in my garage, so I purchased this stand. One of the reasons why I purchased this one over the Everlast one was because I read this one was good for tall people. I'm 6'4\", and this stand is perfect height for you to hit the middle of the bag.\nAssembly was relatively easy and quick. Didn't take longer than 30 minutes for my wife and I to assemble it. The only thing I would complain about is the little \"S hooks\" that it came with. I suppose those thin little things were suppose to hold the bag. I only have a 70lb bag, and they broke in less than 2 minutes. Instead of purchasing a boxing bag chain that others suggested, I went to Lowes and bought a heavy duty \"S-Hook\" for like $4. The bag came with 2 hooks, and it says each can safely hold 420lbs. I'm using both, but those are pretty solid. The reason why I didn't purchase the chain was because it would make the bag hang too low (not ideal for my height).\nI highly recommend that you get weights for this thing. I went for a go without the weights and almost ended up knocking the stand over.\nExactly what I was looking for. Well built holds up well.\nQuick deliver and very easy to put together. I recommend this product and company.\nThis is a great product. It was delivered a day early. It only took me 25 min. to get it assembled with no help. I have a 100 lb. bag that it holds with no problem. I advise you to get weights to hold it down no matter how heavy your bag is. I've tipped mine over the first day testing it with a few kicks. Only one problem with it that I've adjusted and that was how low my bag was. I fixed the chains on my bag to make it sit higher. I recommend this item to all of my friends.\nPerfect, works great as long as it's anchored down.\nGreat for our 80b punching bag. We haven't had any stability issues with ours tipping or moving - that being said, maybe I'm just not hitting it hard enough.\nGreat stand! My husband is 6'2\" and used rings from Lowes to raise the bag for his height. Worked perfectly with this stand. The stand also keeps the noise in the house down since the bag isn't attched to the joists of the house now. Great buy.\neasy to put together and appears to be pretty solid. I use it 3 times a week with a 80 lb bag and have not had any issues.\nit is a sturdy piece but does need weights to hold it down. I guess it depends on how heavy the bag is and how hard you hit.\nI'm a woman and put this together with ease with the help of my 15yr old son. Great we love it!!\nThis bag was fairly easy to put together. Very sturdy, it holds up an 80lb bag with ease!\nI wish it had a provision or bar underneath to attach the bag's bottom bungee to, but it's not a dealbreaker!\nGood purchase, very easy to put together. My only complaint is that it is a little short, might need to put it up on another stand to get it a little more eye-level. I'm 5'11\" and I need to crouch in order to hit the bag in the sweet spot.\nThis works really well and is easy to instal. But it did not come with the weights as promised.\nwas able to set it up with my 100 lbs punching bag, so far, standing really strong.\nGets the job done, however the two \"S\" bag hooks it comes were worthless. I put a 70lb bag on it, hit it four times before the hooks bent, popped off and struck me in the shoulder. If it had hit me in the eye, this would be a very, very different review. Hit up Home Depot for a better hook or clip. The one I purchased is rated to support 2500lb and it only cost me around $5, so I can even hang and swing on it with no issues. Besides that, it is a great and affordable stand.\nCheap and get's the job done.\nA great combo with the Everlast Bags. Cheap and of good quality. Assembly will take some time but all the necessary tools are provided.\nI recommend purchasing 2 large sandbags or plate weights to anchor the stand down. Any impact WILL shift or clank the stand and its quite loud.\nNot an issue if you wish to nail the stand directly into the ground but I'm assuming that most people don't want a permanent hole in their pavement.\nIt has worked as expected. It was easy to assemble and does not take up much space. works very well.\nEasy to put together. Light weight, so I can move by myself. One thing, the bigger bolts are a rare size so I had to search out friends who had the size in order to tighten bolts without scrapping them.\nThis stand is easy to assemble and is quite sturdy, especially with added weights on the front pegs. However I had two issues with the product. First, the description states an 86\" height. This would make it among the tallest of the heavy bag stands available, and one of the reasons that I purchased it. However my measurements show an 84\" height unless you add 2\" for the eyebolt that pokes above the high point of the stand. While I would have liked the extra height (I would prefer my bag to hang higher) it is not a major problem. The second point is that two brackets and bolts were missing from the package. These were not critical (a trip to the hardware store is all it takes) but rather annoying.\nI did enough research to know this was a great price for this type of product and was delighted to get it with amazon's free shipping. it is a little light, as other reviewers have commented. We did put quite a bit of weight on the legs, but we've been very happy with it. It's a nice, quality product and there's no sense in paying more for something that works as well.\nThe stand was easy to assemble and directions were pretty good. The packaging of the nuts, bolts, washers etc. were very good. They were identified and numbered. Diections and pictures were specific, which was great. There were a couple extras on the stand I wasn't sure of such as two vertical bars that were id'd to put weights on and there were two foam pieces that went over a bar in the center bottom area that might be for doing sit ups. I havent set the bag up yet because I need a way to hook the bag to the eyebolt.\nEnclosed instructions made the bag stand a breeze to put together. The stand is relatively lightweight, and it WILL move if you hit the bag really hard. That's to be expected. The pegs in front of the stand on either side are intended for adding weight to the unit, so it stays in place. USE THEM.\nYou probably know someone who's trying to give away a weight bench, or (more likely) has a weight bench they don't use. Take their weights.\nIn all, this stand is worth it for the price, and perfect for someone who doesn't want to permanently mount a heavy bag on their wall.\nI bought a banana bag for MMA/mauy thai and was not able to install a mount since I'm renting so I looked for the tallest stand (for banana bag) and the widest base (so your kicks don't hit the base) this was it. Now I got the stand before the bag. Very easy to put together and worth the money as far as quality. When the 6 ft banana bag came it was way too tall. I wrapped the chains through the hook all at the 5th ring and it shortened to bag just enough for it to work. Only problem after that is this 100 lb bag moves the entire stand when it moves even with heavy weights on it. I put a yoga pad underneath is to prevent this, weight on the pegs as well as underneath the base on the front to lift the bag from the ground and weight on the back where the foot pads are but no weights under the base at the back of the stand, which has made it work out just fine.\nBottom line great for reguar boxing bags, but I highly reccommend getting a mountfor banana bags. Otherwise just do what I did and it will be okay.\nUnfortunately one of the bottom brackets were missing. But it's a good stand. Really need this bracket, I hope there's a way to get in touch with someone who can help me.\nI needed a stand for a corner of my basement and this fit the bill. I also bought a 80 lb. bag and so far it's held up really well.\nThe stand is solid and holds a heavy bag with no problems. Putting it together was very easy. I followed the directions and put it together by myself. I cant recall how long it took me but i dont remember it taking very long at all.\nIt does what its meant to. For the price i cant complain about this purchase at all! I use it about 3-4 times a week and it hasnt failed me at all.\nThe one thing i will suggest is that you purchase some 25 lb weights to put in the pegs that stick out in front of the floor stand (hope that makes sense). I say this because the bag can be a little woppely if your having an intense work out, hitting your bag hard. With some weights on those pegs the legs stay on the ground and takes away the wobble. I imagine that is why the pegs are there in the first place anyway.\nOverall i am satisfied with the purchase. Looks good, holds my heavy bag, allows me to do what i intended to do. I recommend this item.", "version": "v0"}

Now WipeOut XL is poised to take anti-gravity racing completely over the edge.\nLightning-fast reflexes rule in this race 'n' chase thriller where your goal is to stay in the lead and defend your craft against other pilots. Negotiate hairpin turns, make gut-wrenching drops and initiate jumps all while blasting your opponents with intimidating weaponry.\nWith faster, smoother graphics, more tracks, more vehicles, and more weapons, WipeOut XL sets a new standard in 32-bit gaming!\nHistory: In early 1996, a very slick futuristic racing game appeared that needed some really powerful hardware to run. The game sequel has been anticipated and is now close to release with the sequel in the rest of the world called WipeOut 2097 and in the US and Canada WipeOut XL. Why is it that we cannot have the same name in the whole wide world you ask. Well it is because many companies cannot exist without a lot of petty bickering over names. So if you are confused think of the company executives that are embroiled in these name battles. Reminds me of the name battles we had as kids. Smile.\nGame play: There are four major challenges in the game which will involve the player racing multiple tracks. The challenges start out easy and get increasingly harder. The player will be rewarded with new game features on completion of a challenge and will be able to save their progress either on a Memory Card or by using the password system.\nFeatures include arcade style racing with checkpoints, shield damage meters and pit lanes. You can now eliminate enemy competitors from the track - but beware you can also be eliminated. Psygnosis invested a lot of time improving the general feel of the game play. Features such as more accurate and forgiving collisions, exciting new weapons and more enemies to race against result in a far more polished and pure gaming experience. Enhanced data storage methods mean that loading times between menu and game have been greatly reduced.\nModes: There are four racing modes including two multi-player discussed below, including Arcade, Time Trial, Two player Head to Head and Two player Arcade. Arcade (main mode). Racing against eleven other competitors. Finishing in position 1st, 2nd or 3rd will award the player with Gold, Silver and Bronze medals respectively. Time Trial is a race against the clock. No enemy racers or weapon grids. Player receives one turbo per lap. For the two player versions see multi-player below.\nTwo new racing classes (racing speeds) making a total of four. A slower racing class caters for beginners, while an ultra quick racing class will satisfy die hard Wipeout fans.\nThe Time Trial option has a ghost racer which represents your best race. It means the player continuously knows whether they are on target for a record race or not and is a vast improvement over the original game where you only knew how successful you were when you crossed the line.\nRacing teams and classes: All teams have individual craft designs. The teams are: AG Systems from Japan, Auricom Research from the USA, Qirex from Russia and FEISAR from the European Consortium. There is also rumor of a newcomer team to the F5000 league.\nThere are four racing classes (racing speeds). Vector is the easiest and aimed at the first time Wipeout player. Venom is faster for the slightly more experienced player. Rapier is very fast and is aimed at the expert player.\nWeapons and Powerups: A host of new weapons and powerups with some great real time special effects. There is a new, intelligent weapon activating system which distributes weapons and powerups based on the player's race position. There is a range of new weapons and powerups in Wipeout XL as well as the favorites from Wipeout, including missiles, rockets, electrobolt, thunder bomb, quake, plasma bold, mines, turbo, auto-pilot, emergency E pack, and shield. The missile is fired from the front of the craft, and has heat seeking capability. There are three rockets fired together from the front of the craft. The intense electro-static energy of the Electrobolt weapon causes the target craft to shake whilst slowly draining it's shield energy. The thunder bomb flash causes a major energy drain on all visible crafts. The Quake releases a flaming earthquake down the track damaging crafts by knocking them in the air.\nThe Plasma Bolt requires a 2 second charge-up time before a super powerful plasma blast is fired down the track. This weapon is not heat seeking, but a successful hit will cause major shield energy damage. The Mines releases a batch of five mines from the back end of the craft which hover for a few seconds and then explode.\nThe Turbo boosts speed very quickly for a few seconds. Good for overtaking. The Autopilot automatically steers the craft along the track for about 5 seconds. All you have to worry about is the accelerator button! The Emergency E-Pak replenishes shield energy. The Shield protects against enemy weapon attacks and collision damage for about 5 seconds. Cannot activate another weapon whilst the shield is activated.\nTracks (called Circuits in Europe): There are eight completely new circuits (two of them are hidden in the game). Locations are set across the world. The new circuits feature impressive animated scenery and some even have weather. The difficulty is keyed into the track, not into a user adjustable matrix of skill attenuators, which is the prefered method. Two tracks are easy (novice), two intermediate, and two hard.\nArtificial intelligence: Improved artificial intelligence on enemy crafts. We have given each enemy craft on the grid (and there are 12 now) a series of variables for racing ability and weapons ability. This means that we have been able to carefully tune the level of challenge for both beginners and experts. Having an increased amount of craft on the track means that the player never feels that they are racing alone.\nInterface: A new menu system makes getting where you want in the program easier.\nViews: Internal and external view feature allows both first person and third person perspective.\nGraphics: The approximately 400,000 polygons per track with multiple resolutions means that the game will look better than the first one. Designers Republic have designed new logos for teams, racing classes and weapons. There are enhanced lighting effects.\nAnimation: The animation is 50% faster in expert mode. There are 150 thousand textured, shaded polygons per sec. This means that the game runs in 25 FPS for PAL and 30 FPS for NTSC, and the fps depends upon the power of the PC when playing the PC game, but 30 fps should be easy for a fast Pentium. The animation has been optimized for 3D accelerators.\nMusic score: The sounds and music were selected to complete the player's immersion in the game. From the Dolby Surround sound effects to the soundtrack featuring Chemical Brothers, Future Sound of London, Fluke, The Prodigy, Photek, Cold Storage and more - we have spared no effort to bring home the blazing futuristic thrills you've come to expect. The wave tracks are 33 to 35 seconds long. All the music tracks from Cold Storage were written and produced in-house by Tim Wright. The Cold Storage techno sound track drives right through the game. One of the best soundrtracks available.\nSound effects: Audio cues to the action in the game run throughout, giving you directional information and allowing you to keep your eyes on the fast paced action.\nMulti-player: There are two multi-player modes: two player head to head and two player arcade. Two player Head to Head is a frenzied one on one race with no computer controlled racers. Two player Arcade is the same as Head to Head but with all the computer controlled crafts racing as well. Two Player serial link supported.\nGlen Broderick, Computer Player, volume 3, number 6, January, 1997, pg. 38.", "version": "v0"}

The 360 is available in a wide range of COTS configurations including mobile, pan-tilt-zoom and fixed mount scenarios. NEW the 360 now has options for color imaging and visible CCD imaging options. Contact us to day to discuss the latest evolution of this superior surveillance system.\n* Color thermal imaging for target discrimination.\n* Flat panel LCD monitors from 5\" to 50\"\n* Fiber optic and wireless compatible configurations.\n* Custom designed systems are always available to meet your needs.\nThe SPI-IR 360C Thermal Camera System is one of the basic building blocks of our rugged military grade family of environmentally hardened double enclosure thermal surveillance designs. The enclosure is the same one that is used in our mobile and fixed mount pan tilt systems (minus the pan tilt of course) and can be mounted in a variety of fixed positions. The IR 360 double enclosure has several distinct advantages over competing models.\nThe enclosure features sealed hardware mounting so that there are no boltholes that extend from the outer environment into the thermal sensor / lens cavity. Due to this engineered design the unit is able to maintain its environmental hardness even with loose or completely missing bolts. Competing units that use through bolts with backing nuts will loose complete environmental integrity if just one bolt becomes loose or is missing.\nThe IR 360 environmental housing comes standard with a carbon hardened germanium window. Competing brands may offer low-grade non-hardened germanium or inferior silicone type windows in an effort to cut costs. We have found that non-hardened germanium windows are completely unsuited to military grade applications and systems installed with this technology will notice a steady decline in image quality as the window becomes scratched and pitted from ordinary environmental stresses. This is especially critical in mobile applications where we have seen systems with non-hardened windows become completely unusable in a matter of months. Additionally, low cost silicone windows have lower transmission values and durability than premium carbon hardened germanium pieces and are never used in the IR-360 line of thermal infrared camera systems.\nInternal thermostatically controlled heating elements provide you with maximum usability in the widest range of environmental extremes. Many companies offer a variety of systems to claim extreme weather readiness including wipers, heat sinks and simple insulation. We have found that wipers are a neat item to look at but in the real world they offer little if no usable benefit to icing problems. In addition wipers are a costly item (in terms of initial system design and maintenance) that must be regularly replaced. In a fixed pole or building mount scenario this would require man power to climb the pole and either replace the wiper at the top of the pole or un-mount the entire camera assembly and bring it to the ground for repair. Neither solution lends to maximum uptime for the unit. Heat sink devices and insulation solutions can only offer a limited amount of time until they become overwhelmed by the constant stress of environmental extremes. The only reliable long-term solution we have found is our rock solid thermostatically controlled heater elements. The heater element will provide you with continuous operation of internal thermal imaging electronics and maintain a consistent lens temperature that is critical to accurate thermal imager performance.\nThe IR 360 line of thermal camera systems has completely sealed thermal sensor and lens packages. This might seem like a no-brainer but it is in fact not an industry standard. Competing systems in effort to cut costs have left the lens exposed to the elements or at least the front face of the lens. Some may even claim that it is a carbon hardened germanium lens and it sealed around the side for protection from the elements. This design strategy has several glaring flaws in it. First and foremost a thermal infrared lens system (especially long range versions) are very costly and generally make up a good portion of the cost to acquire the system. Even carbon hardened germanium optics will wear out eventually when exposed to the elements. When this happens it is time to scrape the most expensive single piece of the system and replace it. Next we have the issue of the lens and detector being in two different environments and possibly a wide range of temperature extremes. This type of scenario does not lend it self to accurate imaging performance. The IR 360 never comes with an exposed lens surface and it is our opinion that you should not even consider such a design for any military grade applications.\nInternal stainless steel gears and chains offer long-term stability and resist breakage under hard loading such as in a mobile mounted scenario. Other models can employ belt drives, aluminum or even plastic internal components that we feel will fail under military loading conditions. If a drive belt slips or plastic gears crack while the unit is mounted on an HMMWV (High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle) then the system would become useless until it was disassembled and repaired. We feel that a steel drive train offers the user the most durable rock solid solution to high demand thermal imaging applications.\nTASS (Tactical Automated Security System) sometimes referred to as Tactical Automated Sensor System means that the IR 360 has meet or exceeded certain parameters set for by the US Air Force TASS program. In other words the IR 360 thermal sensors \u201cplay\u201d well with other intrusion and surveillance sensor systems and can be easily tied into a new or existing security system for full time network centric security.\nNetwork Centric capability allows the IR 360 systems to be tied into other systems via analog, digital or Ethernet configurations allowing for a free flow of security information among battlefield and security systems. The systems can easily integrate into C4ISR system architecture providing the sensor in sensor to shooter configurations. Our Pan Tilt FLIR sensors can provide invaluable information to troops involved in MOUT (Military Operations in Urban Terrain) situations were airborne sensor data (even from low flying UAV\u2019s) may not be able to show the soldier crucial elements of his surroundings. Our pan tilt systems allow direct access of sensor to shooter during military operations in urban terrain. The easy integration of our vehicle mounted pan tilt thermal systems allows the information gathered on the ground to be passed up the system of systems architecture to enhance the overall aerial picture of a complex urban battlefield.

Lean muscle tissue determines your metabolism, your energy level, impacts your strength & agility, even your ability to fight disease.\nUnlike starvation diets or sweating off pounds at a typical Grand Rapids gym, only to gain them right back, building your body's precious lean muscle is the key to looking good and being healthy over the long term.\nLean muscle tissue actually burns calories at a rate 3.5 times that of fat. Yet a pound of fat takes up to 3 times more volume than a pound of muscle!\nUnfortunately, nature hates to see something as good as lean muscle go to waste. So unless we build and protect it, we lose it.\nIn fact, without strength training, we can lose as much as 10 pounds of muscle a decade or more! That's why so many people gain weight after their twenties. Excessive dieting and cardio exercise can even accelerate the loss, leading to even further weight gain over time.\nThe good news is that with proper strength training, you can build or replace what nature and time are trying to take away from you.

Can we see this event as NATO\u2019s expansion into the East?\nA: Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the West has moved closer and closer to Russian borders. The former Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev has claimed that when he reached an agreement with the West to allow the dissolution of the Soviet Union and German unification, the West promised that NATO \u201cwould not expand into the East\u201d. However, the West has rejected his claim.\nIn any case, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War provided a great opportunity for reconciliation in the European continent that was missed. For decades, the world had been divided between the two superpowers and their satellites, with thousands of nuclear weapons aimed at each other. Humanity was in great danger of annihilation as the result of a nuclear clash between those two blocs, as could be seen over the Cuban crisis.\nWith the end of the Cold War, the world breathed a sigh of relief and many people hoped that hostilities between the two blocs would end for good. The Warsaw Pact was dismantled, and indeed most former Soviet satellites became members of the European Union and even of NATO.\nHowever, the West saw the collapse of the Soviet Union as a victory by the West and treated Russia, which had come to its knees facing severe economic and political problems, not as an equal but as a vanquished foe. Had Russia been incorporated into Europe, as many East European and Baltic countries were, the world could have experienced a long period of peace and stability with a big drop in military expenditure by both sides.\nOne can blame both sides for renewed hostilities. The West accuses Russia and particularly President Vladimir Putin of wishing to reinstate the former Soviet zone of influence, while Russia blames the West of expansionism and a desire to encircle Russia with NATO bases. The Russian involvement in Georgia to prevent it from joining NATO, the coup in Ukraine supported by the West, the annexation of Crimea by Russia, and Russian military involvement in the civil war in Syria have intensified hostility between the West and Russia.\nIn order to deter Russia from encroaching into her former satellites, the West has set up a chain of bases in those countries, and the missile defense shield is a part of those measures. Initially, the Americans maintained that the missile defense system was aimed at preventing Iranian nuclear weapons from reaching the West. Since signing the JCPOA agreement with Iran, the West cannot use that excuse any longer, and Russia sees the missile defense shield as a major threat that will undermine her deterrence.\nRightly or wrongly, many Russians believe that Russia is vulnerable to a sudden Western attack that could destroy most of Russian nuclear warheads. If the West also builds a missile defense shield against Russian retaliation, the nuclear deterrence, or the concept of MAD (mutual assured destruction), would lose its value and Russia would have no option but to surrender to Western demands. This may be a form of paranoia, but in politics perception plays a major role.\nRecently, the United States switched on the $800 million missile shield ironically at a Soviet-era base in Romania, again saying that it was aimed at the so-called rogue states, but speaking to his top military officers, President Putin said: \"This is not a defense system. This is part of U.S. nuclear strategic potential brought onto a periphery. In this case, Eastern Europe is such periphery.\" He went on to say: \"Until now, those taking such decisions have lived in calm, fairly well-off and in safety. Now, as these elements of ballistic missile defense are deployed, we are forced to think how to neutralize emerging threats to the Russian Federation.\" All this sounds very ominous.\nQ: Is there any substance to such fears?\nA: There are certainly some hardliners in the United States and Europe who have not given up their dream of a unipolar world, with the United States as the only global hegemon. Some Western officials are talking of a possible clash with Russia.\nThis view is clearly not shared by many others who argue that Western wars during the past decade have been very costly, both in blood and treasure, and that America should not act as a world policeman. The debate between the hawks and doves is certainly continuing, and those involved in the Military Industrial Complex on both sides may be fanning the flames of a conflict. But most people are not interested in a major conflict with Russia, because it serves no real purpose and could be very costly for the whole world.\nEarlier in May, two high-ranking U.S. generals made statements about the need \"to deter Moscow\" and build up military potential to that end. A senior British general, General Sir Richard Shirreff, who until recently was the Deputy Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, has just published a book with the alarming title \u201c2017 War with Russia\u201d. Although the book is fictional, he argues that the West should fortify its defenses in order to deter a Russian invasion of the Baltic States.\nQ: How will Russia react to the decision to install a ballistic missile defense system in Eastern Europe?\nA: There are hardliners and moderates both in the West and Russia. Many Russians feel that their country cannot sustain a military and economic assault by the West, and the best option would be to reduce the tension and reach a compromise with the West. Some Russian generals have argued that Russia is not prepared to face a major war either at home or abroad.\nOn the other hand, there are those who believe that the West is pushing too hard against Russia with the aim of totally encircling her, and the pressure would continue unless Russia is prepared to confront the United States and raise the stakes for the West. A leading British investigative journalist, Alastair Crooke, in an article in Huffington Post on 16 May with the headline \u201cPutin is Being Pushed to Abandon His Conciliatory Approach To the West and Prepare for War\u201d, argued that some hardline \u201cnationalists\u201d in Moscow have accused President Putin of weakness towards the West and are calling for a more robust response.\nQ: Are we witnessing a new Cold War?\nA: Yes, sadly we see many signs of a return to the Cold War period. The rhetoric on both sides has become quite hostile and menacing, with many senior U.S. officials openly saying that they see Russia as the greatest threat to the United States. On the other hand, President Putin also accuses the West of aggressive behavior.\nThe hostility is not limited to rhetoric, but there are also many examples of a return to a confrontational relationship. The West has imposed economic sanctions on Russia that are hurting the Russian economy. There are many countries whose athletes have been accused of doping, but Russia has been singled out for condemnation and barred from taking part in international competitions until further notice. Even the Eurovision song contest, which is supposed to be a light-hearted musical show to bring the European countries together, has been politicized. In the last contest earlier this month, a mediocre song by the team from Ukraine about Stalin\u2019s expulsion of the Tartars from Crimea was voted for as the winning song, mainly due to anti-Russian voting by some delegates.\nAll of this points to the seeming inevitability of future conflict. This is why it is essential that before the situation gets out of hand both sides should take a step back and should turn to cooperation instead of confrontation. Western sanctions are certainly hurting Russia. At the same time, the West will not be able to cope with the problems of terrorism and instability in the Middle East without Russian support. The two sides can gain more by cooperation rather than confrontation.\nA: In my view, it will have little effect on Iranian security. Even in the past, Iran\u2019s role in the defense shield was mainly used for propaganda purposes because Iran did not possess nuclear weapons or intercontinental ballistic missiles. The only way that the current situation can impact Iran is as the result of the hostility between Russia and the West, which will create a less stable situation in the region and the world. It is in Iran\u2019s best interests to remain impartial in this rivalry and maintain good relations with both sides.", "version": "v0"}

I figured she was just watching the video and not listening, but then later that night she said, \u201cDad, did you know T-Rex\u2019s were carnivores?\u201d I told her I did, then asked her if she knew what it meant to be a carnivore.

In particular, residents of more remote states often have no idea about the subtleties of Colombian culture. For some it is the homeland of coffee, for others \u2013 centers for drug trafficking, for the third ones \u2013 always dancing smiling people.\nDue to the fact that Colombia is a country with the most colorful culture and population and here you can find most of the traditions and trends of the world, this territory has become the center of another not quite justified stereotype. Colombia is divided into districts, and the residents of each of them are given a certain \"name\". Thus, thanks to their residents, these districts have a distinctive character. For example, \"Chechakos\", residents of Bogota and the surrounding areas, are quite cold and arrogant people, focused on work and politics. \"Llaneros\", North-East districts \u2013 stern and hard-working and very closed people. Residents of the southern districts, on the contrary, are uncontrollably talkative and obsessed with bullfighting. All these assumptions are conjectures and, of course, have little in common with reality. Colombians are cheerful hospitable people who are interested in everything that happens around, and support any topic of conversation, except politics.\nIn Colombia, almost everyone addresses each other on the formal \"You\". This applies not only to strangers or official communication, but also parents/children and brother/sister relationships. Quite often such addressing is found when addressing to pet.\nMost people in Colombia live in quite hot settlements. And Bogota, the capital of the country, located at an altitude of 2,600 m, is considered unbearably cold for Colombians. They even called it a \"fridge\". FYI, the average temperature in Bogot\u00e1 is + 15\u00b0 C.\nColumbia residents are ardent fans of football. And Colombians walk around the city all day in yellow T-shirts when the local team plays in the championship.\nColombians believe that family is the most important thing in life. No career, friends, fun can replace family happiness. Therefore, it is customary to spend every weekend inside the family hearth.\nColombia is recognized as the country with the happiest residents in the world. This is proved by the innumerable number of holidays and festivals held in this country.", "version": "v0"}

I am not sure when people will finally realize that flu shots do not prevent the flu. Most people are very much aware that these shots can provide side effects that are similar to symptoms of the flu.\nThe CDC appears to be closely connected to the drug companies who sell the vaccines, and I suspect that they somehow benefit financially. How else can one explain their hyperinflated statistics and dire warnings.\nI get aggravated by the media who participate in this yearly scam to encourage people to get flu shots after reporting the number of flu deaths. It is fairly well recognized that people dying from influenza have compromised immune systems in almost all cases.\nObviously, the approach to flu prevention is to enhance your immune system. Something as simple as vitamin D3 prevents every flu there is when taken in the correct amount (which is a lot higher than the ridiculous recommendation of the Institute of Medicine of 400 IU/day).\nI recommend at least 10,000 IU per day which should be taken with vitamin K2 to prevent calcification of arteries. For those who prefer not to go shopping, you can order a combination vitamin D3/ vitamin K capsules or liquid from my office \u2013 760-836-3232 or by the web: www.plattwellness.com.\nTo be fully covered, you can start with 50,000 IU capsules for the first week or so, and then go to the 5,000 IU capsules.\nI found this website very funny and I just wanna thanks for that.

A new character seems to be emerging for James's third post-Decision appearance in Cleveland - Contrite LeBron.\n\"I think it would be great, it would be fun to play in front of these fans,\" Contrite LeBron said Thursday when asked about suiting up for the Cavs again some day should the opportunity arise. \"I had a lot of fun times here. You can't predict the future. If I decide to come back, hopefully the fans will accept me.\"\nJames not unexpectedly qualified this statement by saying he's happy in Miami. The conversation was strictly of the blue sky variety anyway, as he's not eligible for free agency for another two seasons and has an option for two more after that.\nOur ex-lover had a more interesting response when asked if he would play for Cavaliers' owner Dan Gilbert, what with the niggling little matter hanging between them of James embarrassing Gilbert on national TV followed by an...impassioned response from that worthy, which included a capitalized, bold-faced guarantee that the Cavs would win a championship \"BEFORE THE SELF-TITLED FORMER 'KING' WINS ONE.\"\nLeBron has not spoken to Gilbert since the July 2010 free agency period, but claims he doesn't hold a grudge against his former boss.\n\"He said what he said out of anger,\" James said. \"He probably would want to take that back, but I made a mistake, too. There's some things I'd want to take back as well. You learn from your mistakes and move on.\"\nCup your ears and get out your shoe-phone decoder, folks, and you may hear an actual apology in there somewhere. James similarly danced around an apology to Cleveland fans a couple of months back during an interview with ESPN.\nI love how some SEO-tricksters use clever headlines to steer search traffic to their site? Like \"Who's perfoming at halftime in the Superbowl?\" Will there be a wardrobe malfunction? Or like the Huffington Post did last year, \"What time does the superbowl start?\"\nI mean (A) How desperate for search traffic do you have to be? and (B) Who gives a sh*t, the Browns aren't playing. Again.\nIn case you aren't following the happenings with Ohio's lone representative in the NHL, the Columbus Blue Jackets are having their worst season in the 12 year history of the franchise. Going into the All Star Break this past weekend, the Blue Jackets are dead last in the NHL. 23 points out of a playoff spot. 32 points out of fourth place in their division. Adding to the insult, the Blue Jackets have one of the highest payrolls in the league. This is not a good hockey team and the problems start at the top.\nThis past Saturday saw an estimated 250 Blue Jackets fans stage a protest at Nationwide Arena. Fans gathered to console each other and call for change, hoping their voices would be heard by majority owner John P. McConnell. Pleas to mercifully remove GM Scott Howson and President Mike Priest from their positions were both spoken and written on signs. The Columbus Dispatch did an admirable job of covering the protest, which you can read about on their website.\nI first heard about this protest last Wednesday. I admit that I thought it was a waste of time by a lot of self-proclaimed internet heroes. To my surprise, less than a week later, their impact is already being felt.\nLess than 2 days after the first plans were being bandied about, majority owner John P. McConnell did an interview with Dispatch beat writer Aaron Portzline. Whether this was a preemptive strike or not, McConnell showed that he respects the fan base by acknowledging their protest and agreeing that things need to change. He also said that he would make sure that \u201chot liquids\u201d would be there for the rag tag group of protesters on the cold January afternoon.\nMy first instinct was that this was a PR move, complete with attempts at humor. Then, less than a few hours after the interview was published on the Puck Rakers Blog, Mr. McConnell sent a letter to the season ticket holders. I was hoping that it would be written in Comic Sans, but apparently that is reserved for a different type of frustration. McConnell's letter detailed his disappointment, but it also didn\u2019t indicate any solutions. He said changes would be coming in the next few weeks and months, but they could not be shared at this time. This sympathetic PR machine was in full force and it wouldn\u2019t be doing so if the movement wasn\u2019t happening. Regardless of the sincerity of the letter and interview, the protest plans were gaining momentum.", "version": "v0"}

She majored in Theater Studies at Yale and then moved to New York to become a Big Star. She soon discovered that she had a crippling attachment to food and shelter, and that her acting \u201ccareer\u201d was unlikely to yield much of either, so she got a job in children\u2019s media. Twenty-mumble years later, she is a creative executive at a major media company and writes in her spare time. She and her husband, who met as acting interns at the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival, live in New York City. They enjoy seeing unreasonable amounts of theater, hosting raucous dinner parties and traveling.\nIt's not the end of the world, but for Rooney Harris it's starting to feel that way. It's the beginning of senior year, and her mom just lost her job. Even worse, she isn't planning to get another one. Instead, she's spending every waking moment with a group called the Next World Society, whose members are convinced they'll be leaving Earth behind on November 17. It sounds crazy to Rooney, but to her mother and younger brother it sounds like salvation. As her mom's obsession threatens to tear their lives apart, Rooney is scrambling to hold it all together. But will saving her family mean sacrificing her dreams -- or theirs?\nTell us a little bit about COME NOVEMBER and introduce us to Rooney.\nAs the book begins, Rooney Harris is entering her senior year of high school. She\u2019s been forced into a quasi-parental role because her mother is so wrapped up in the Next World Society, a group that believes that on November 17, they are going to be transported to a new planet to re-start human civilization. Rooney\u2019s very frustrated with her mom, and feels responsible for her younger brother, Daniel. She really just wants to get through senior year and go off to college like everyone else, but her mother\u2019s beliefs derail her plans.\nRooney definitely isn\u2019t me, but we do have some things in common. We both believe that we need to be in control of every situation and we tend to be a little too convinced of our own rightness. We both default to anger when we\u2019re out of our depth. And Rooney may also sound a little bit like me. Beyond that, she\u2019s totally her own person.\nWhat sparked the idea to write COME NOVEMBER? Did the plot come first, or your characters?\nHow did you approach creating Everett?\nAs the leader of the Next World Society, Everett had to be someone who could come across as either impressive or a con artist \u2013 he needed to have a little ambiguity. For believers, Everett\u2019s way of speaking might make him seem intelligent and credible, but a skeptic could easily read him as someone who\u2019s hiding something behind a lot of flowery language and a fancy accent. I also needed Everett to serve as the mouthpiece for a catalog of facts about climate change that are real and important. So I made him someone whose primary form of address is the monologue: he enjoys the sound of his own voice and is used to commanding the attention in a room.\nWhat about creating the Next World Society?\nI just tried to imagine all the different kinds of people who might be drawn in by someone like Everett and by his message. In the first draft of the book I included a few additional storylines that tracked some of the other members of the NWS \u2013 people who were really tearing their families apart in order to follow Everett. Ultimately those characters got cut, but I\u2019m still really moved by the idea of people having to make that terrible choice.\nHave you always been interested in environmental/climate change issues? How did you research these areas?\nYeah, I\u2019m a little obsessed. One of my friends likes to call me \u201cCassandra\u201d because I can\u2019t shut up about it (I used that for the character of Anjelica in the book). There are a few writers who have shaped my understanding of what we\u2019re facing. Elizabeth Kolbert is one; she\u2019s such a strong, vivid writer and makes things so clear and easy to understand. There\u2019s also a book by Mark Lynas about how the planet is going to respond as the atmosphere warms that I was very influenced by.\nI also read a lot about flood plains in New York City. My original outline for the book actually included a massive hurricane hitting New York and causing catastrophic flooding. But by the time I had a few chapters written I realized there was just WAY too much incident in the book and some stuff had to fall by the wayside, so I eliminated the whole hurricane storyline. And then the following year Superstorm Sandy decimated huge swaths of New York and I thought, \u201cit\u2019s a good thing I cut that part, since everyone would assume I added it in response to what happened.\u201d But yeah, Cassandra saw that one coming.\nCOME NOVEMBER is chock full of fleshed out supporting characters, including Rooney\u2019s mother, Anneliese. Can you tell us how you developed this character?\nAnneliese is the one character who was loosely based on a real person. Not her involvement with the NWS or anything like that, just the way she talks and looks. That childlike quality. This woman was related to a friend of mine, and I remember talking to her once, and her saying, \u201cit was just super\u2026 DUPER!\u201d in this breathy, excited little-girl voice, and I thought that was hysterical, and so alien to me that it really intrigued me.\nMrs. Fisher was inspired by a newsletter from the wonderful Quaker boarding school my husband attended. I love reading their communications because they\u2019re always so thoughtful about caring for people and for the world. Back when I first started working on the book, they sent out this letter about a Ghanaian scholarship student who was just crushing it at the school. He sounded like an all-around spectacular person: A great student, athlete and human being. And I thought that was such an interesting background for a person, so I borrowed it for Mrs. Fisher.\nFor the aspiring writers who may read this, please share a bit about your path to publication.\nAnd then that offer fell through and no one else wanted it. It was just a flood of rejections. So based on the feedback we were getting I spent about six months doing a massive rewrite on the book. I cut around 150 pages and reworked huge sections of it, and still no one wanted it. And the flood of rejections turned into a trickle. And two years passed, and I basically gave up hope and moved on to trying to focus on the next book, when we suddenly got the offer from Scholastic. Let me just say, it\u2019s a good thing I have a day job and a fulfilling home life, because I would have lost my mind if all my emotional energy had been focused on publishing this book.\nHow has your background in theater and children\u2019s entertainment informed your fiction writing?\nHaving trained as an actor, I\u2019m always very focused on the way characters sound. I have to be able to hear them in my head and on my tongue, and I\u2019m very critical of anything that sounds inauthentic or not like the way humans talk and behave. I\u2019m much more confident about dialogue than I am about plot.\nI don\u2019t really have favorite writers, but I have favorite books. In the YA space, I love Eleanor & Park and I\u2019ll Give you the Sun and Two Boys Kissing. Some of my favorite novels for adults are Corelli\u2019s Mandolin and The Time Traveler\u2019s Wife. If a book can make me laugh and cry without ever feeling manipulated, it will have my heart forever. Bonus points if it also makes me think about something I never would have come to on my own.\nWhen you are not writing, what are your favorite hobbies & activities?\nI love to cook, love to have close friends over for a meal. My husband and I go to the theater a lot, since we both come out of that acting background. We do a fair bit of traveling \u2013 we recently went to Australia to scuba dive on the Great Barrier Reef, which was a bucket list item for me. I used to love dancing, but my body is all busted now, so I take a lot of walks in the park to satisfy my need for movement.\nWhat are you writing now, and when can will we see it?\nI\u2019ve been working on and off on a book about Rooney\u2019s younger brother, Daniel. As I was finishing COME NOVEMBER he was the character I was most interested in spending more time with. I think Rooney\u2019s arc leaves her in a good place at the end of the book, but Daniel is more up in the air. I wanted to know what happened to him. And as for when you can see it\u2026 that\u2019s only partly up to me. As I learned from the process of selling this first book, you can never make any assumptions. But I hope that COME NOVEMBER does well enough that people want to hear more from these characters.\nI just launched my website at katrinvandam.com [katrinvandam.com] and I really hope people check it out. The look of it is very inspired by the beautiful cover art that Maeve Norton created for the book, so every time I look at it I get all happy. I\u2019m also on Instagram at @katvandambooks.\nThe cover is attractive and the synopsis is interesting. Good luck with the novel.\nI've been reading some memoirs about scientology. Come November reminds me of that -- stories like this are so interesting. The cover doesn't necessarily make me want to read it, though.\nI love the cover, it\u2019s so pretty and fallish. The summary has me so excited to read it!\nThe cover is really beautiful and kind of lonely. The synopsis sounds really interesting.\nI've already heard so many great things about this book. It sounds like it will be serious page turner, full of tons of great content! I'm super excited to check this out. Plus the cover is so beautiful, I love the color and details.\nI love the cover. The synopsis sounds unique and intriguing.\nThe cover is very unique and the story sounds very interesting!", "version": "v0"}

Three different juices are combined and spiced with essential oils. Then you can add caramel vodka for an extra kick of flavor, or leave the vodka out for a family friendly drink.\nThank you Yahoo! for sponsoring this post. While this was a #YahooDIY sponsored opportunity from Yahoo!, all content and opinions expressed here are my own.\nI find inspiration for recipes from all over the place. My mom was the queen of using recipes found right on the packaging of our favorite foods. I'm a little more digital and found a lot of my inspiration on the internet. I'm also a magazine fanatic and have more subscriptions to magazines than I care to admit. Combine the two in to a digital magazine and I'm in inspiration heaven. Yahoo! has recently launched some great digital magazines full of amazing inspiration.\nI got lost reading the articles in the Yahoo! magazines like 10 Fun Holiday Crafts for Your Kids and No Dish Left Behind: How to Make Leftovers Last (because I really just don't like leftovers!). I was flipping through this article Don't Buy Another Bottle of Wine: 10 Unique Gifts to Give Your Host, which includes a recipe for homemade cider. That recipe looked a little bit more involved than I wanted at the moment, but it did remind me that I wanted to try out a wassail recipe.\nWassail is traditionally a spiced or mulled wine drink that is served on Christmas Eve. You can also go wassailing, which is basically caroling, while drinking wassail.\nFun, huh?! I wanted a wassail that both adults and kids can enjoy so I used juices instead of wine as the base. I used three different kinds of juice apple cider (see?), cranberry juice and orange juice.\nSpices are added to the wine, or juice, and the concoction is allowed to simmer for a long period of time to allow the flavors to meld. Well, I'm a busy mom and it is slightly less than a miracle that I'd even remember to make wassail so I need something quick to put together. Enter essential oils.\nYou can get a huge punch of flavor quickly by skipping the long cook with spices and just using the oils instead. I used orange, lemon, clove, cinnamon, and frankincense but you can mix and match to find a flavor combination you like best. The frankincense adds a woodsy flavor to the wassail, but it's a tad on the expensive side so you could skip that.\nCombine the juices in pot and let it come to a boil. Remove from heat and add your oils. That's it. You are ready to go! Oh but not quite yet. If you want a little added deliciousness, grab yourself a little bottle of caramel vodka and add a splash of that to your glass. I keep this separate so that the kids can drink from the pot of wassail, too. But if this is for adults only, go ahead and just add it to the pot with the essential oils.\nYou could pour this in to a slow cooker to keep it warm for a long night of wassailing in the neighborhood. You can increase the recipe to feed a bigger crowd. The recipe as written makes enough for 2-3 people.\nInterested in learning more about essential oils? Check out the amazing deal I am offering all my readers to get started in essential oils!\nCombine apple cider, cranberry juice and orange juice in a pot. Heat over high heat just until it reaches a light boil.\nRemove from heat. Add essential oils as recommended, or to taste. Add the vodka to the entire pot for an adult beverage, or allow guests to add it to their cups to keep the wassail family friendly.\nMmm, curling up with a mug of this under a blanket with a good book. Sounds good to me. Thanks for sharing on the Creative K. Kids Tasty Tuesdays Linky Party. We hope you will join us next week.\nNever heard of wassail but if it has caramel vodka in it, then would definitely give it a go!\nThis sounds super cool. I am huge into essential oils right now and I love the idea of a essential oil based cocktail. A caramel apple one at that. Yummmmmmm.\nIt\u2019s amazing! I can\u2019t believe how yummy the oils are in the wassail.", "version": "v0"}

I work out of my home for a small non-profit, so have some of the same issues that you do\u2013no daily face-to-face interactions, and the vast majority of interactions with both my coworkers and project partners are virtual. Lately I\u2019ve started pondering spending at least half a day a week working at a cafe or the library, just to be out and surrounded by people. I wonder about creating a \u201cvirtual water cooler\u201d site where those of us who work alone most days could gather occasionally, or even at pre-set times. Could be via skype to make voice and video easier, or just via chat.\nAs far as waiting patiently vs. working to make things happen, I agree with your \u201ca bit of both\u201d answer. I\u2019ve found that there can be a long lag time between when you start making connections and getting yourself out there and when the possible work opportunities start coming in, so patience is definitely in order, but I\u2019ve also found it useful to actively go after the sorts of projects I want. People may have projects they\u2019ve been thinking about but not acting on, and a conversation with a willing and able partner could be the nudge they need.\nI also just want to say that although we\u2019ve never met, and only talked once (when I interviewed you for the CAKE case studies), I love your approach to work and life, and I think there\u2019s a lot of need in the climate change world for folks like you with a creative sensibility and a non-scientific background.\nThanks for the encouragement Jennie. We should definitely organize a skype water cooler conversation soon (michellelaurie on skype).

So keeping up with other people who work like we do, is a great way to connect and I am always to connect with you virtually on things, and vice versa!\nI am writing into the box right now, late at night and very happy to be connected virtually to a lot of great people in the world.

This includes one of today\u2019s most talked about topics: free trade. To work appropriately, free trade must also be fair trade. Otherwise, one side of the trading partnership loses drastically.\nThere is a very fine line between fair and unfair trade, and finding a balance between the two can take some work. For example, Canada\u2019s domestic policy is to subsidize its lumber producers, thus they produce softwood lumber materials below market prices.\nThis becomes problematic when Canada exports its lumber to the global market, as it can leverage government subsidies to sell its lumber cheaper than other countries (like the United States), that instead rely on prevailing market rates to price their goods. This is simply unfair and gives Canada an artificial advantage over other producers.\nTo be clear, we are not advocating for special privileges or advantages for American companies. We firmly believe trade policy should exist to ensure that all parties \u2014 domestic and international \u2014 are competing on a level playing field. This fosters an economic system where companies thrive because of their own ingenuity, efficiency and skill.\nIn the case of softwood lumber, Canadian federal and provincial governments subsidize their lumber operations, sheltering producers from market lows and giving advantages during market highs.\nWhen the market is good, Canadian producers enjoy bigger profits and the increased ability to invest for the future. When markets are down, they face significantly less pressure to cut production or reduce labor hours.\nCanada maintains these advantages over American producers not because of more efficient lumber production or superior technologies, but because of the subsidies they receive from their government.\nOur experience as border-state senators has enabled us to witness firsthand how this dynamic causes real harm to American workers, companies and communities. We\u2019ve seen how a very innovative and competitive U.S. industry thrives in a free market, but when a foreign government subsidizes its businesses, U.S. workers and business owners lose their jobs and livelihoods.\nTo ensure that communities across the U.S. \u2014 from Missoula to Manchester \u2014 can compete fairly on the global stage, action is needed so that trade laws and agreements are properly enforced to fully address unfair practices. The U.S. must utilize tariffs or trade agreements to ensure everyone is using the same rulebook, allowing for an equal chance at success.\nInvestigations conducted this year by the U.S. Department of Commerce determined that the Canadian government subsidizes softwood lumber production and that Canadian exporters sell softwood lumber at less than fair value.\nEarlier this year, the U.S. International Trade Commission made a preliminary finding that Canadian imports injure the American industry and will make a final determination this month. These findings are consistent with the United States\u2019 obligations under World Trade Organization rules.\nWe believe the tariff rates determined by the government are fair and simply offset the advantages our friends up north have enjoyed for years.\nThrough dozens of trips across the country, it\u2019s clear that the U.S. lumber industry\u2019s opportunity to compete is hampered only by its inability to match artificially low prices while maintaining fair wages for the over 350,000 individuals employed by this important U.S. industry.\nSubsidized Canadian lumber imports are a violation of our trade laws. We were encouraged by the Department of Commerce and International Trade Commission\u2019s enforcement actions.\nThrough their actions, we\u2019re one step closer to restoring fair trade and ensuring that the best businesses survive because of their ingenuity and hard work, not government subsidies.\nSen.

In order to do this there is a few steps. As time goes on I will further continue to update this if anything is changed. Part 1: Harvesting In order to harvest you must first find the weed location. If you don\u2019t want to go look for it and find it yourself ask around there\u2019s always going to be someone to help you. Once you have found the location here you will be able to harvest some pure weed buds you can harvest 10 at a time just walk up to the point and press E and you should begin harvesting. After the message has disappeared and you have stopped picking you will have weed in your inventory. Part 2: Packaging Packaging is found relatively close to the harvest location. Same thing applies walk up to the location press E and you will begin packaging if you receive the message \u201cYou do not have enough bags\u201d this means you do not have any weed in your inventory so you therefore have nothing to package so go harvest some weed. Packaging weed turns it into weed packages this is used to sell to the local dealer spot later. Step 3: Selling There are currently two ways of selling weed. 1. Selling to the local dealer spot, this is a spot on the map you will have to find here you sell your packages of weed to the weed dealer for a low risk of getting caught however the payout is much less as it follows the risk to reward ratio. 2. Selling to local NPCs, this method of selling offers a much greater reward but at a much higher risk. Please note You can not sell packages of weed to the locals in order to sell to them you just keep the weed in it\u2019s purest form freshly picked from the harvest spot. This means you do not need to package to sell to them. Once you have pure weed in your inventory you should be able to walk up to locals roaming the streets and sell to them by pressing H. Be warned not every local is interested and some will snitch on you to the police so be ready to keep wary of your surroundings and always be strategic. Finally happy dealing.\nCool guide, thanks for the effort you put into this!\nFor now don\u2019t be alarmed for an increased amount of gunshots in that area up in the hills, I\u2019m looking into to it so if it was possible we could reduce the notifications up in that area.

Anyway, did anyone enter? Has anyone heard?\nI entered and have not heard anything yet.\nYes and I just got an email that I won!!!!!!!! SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Stoked!\nMy husband and I both won too! Yay!\nI got the email too. Not even sure why I entered. Turns out you have to get your wristband at Little Green Men store by 1 p.m. on June 2. Then return on the day of distribution, I assume June 3, to make your purchase. Really? Could they make it a little more complicated?\nI think (hope) the pins are available on June 2 and have to be purchased before 1PM. After that they are released to the public. It sounds like between 8-10AM you have to get the wristband outside the park. I have no clue where the \"west esplanade information kiosk\" is, but I guess I can find it. After 10:00 you can get the wristband and the pin at the store. But, really? Why can't we just show the email at the store? I guess to prevent multiple transactions? It is complicated, that's for sure.\nPlease print and take this confirmation letter along with a government issued photo ID (or a copy of a birth certificate if you have no such valid photo ID) to the West Esplanade Information Kiosk located outside the main entrance of Disneyland\u00ae Park on June 2, 2011 from one hour prior to Disneyland\u00ae Park opening until one hour after park opening. One hour after park opening Guests may visit Little Green Men Store Command until 1:00 p.m. to redeem for one wristband. Valid photo ID currently includes a government issued driver's license, passport or school ID.\nWristbands are limited and entitle bearers the opportunity to purchase up to 2 limited edition Star Tours Opening Day 2011 pins.\nWristbands will be valid for the purchase of the pin(s) at the designated merchandise location until 1:00 p.m. on the day of distribution. At 1:00 p.m. any remaining pins will be available for purchase at the designated merchandise location by persons who have not previously purchased the pin(s) on the day of release.\nSounds like two different days to me. But I've been wrong before.\nOh, well, I would be super annoyed if it was two different days since the 2nd is our last day at the park. Wait. Just looked at the calendar. The 2nd is Thursday, not Friday, you may be right. Okay. That is a PITA!!! But we will also be there Friday.\nEnter the random drawing below for an opportunity to purchase this pin, scheduled for release June 2, 2011 at Little Green Men Store Command at Disneyland Park.\nSo, maybe it is all on the 2nd? I agree, it is confusing!\nnot more than two minutes after I posted I got the email!\nKinda bummed, I work on Thursday. :( Trying to get the morning off, so I can go get the pins. I have a feeling if I wait till Friday, they wont be left.\nI wonder how many people entered. Everyone I know/heard of that entered won!\nI got mine too. For those challenged by legalese and lots of text - here is a summary.\n1) you need a wristband to buy the pins - and a copy of the email with you. No email - no pins.\n4) after 1pm all remaining pins are available for anyone else to purchase.\nI won too and I understood the instructions the way olegc explained.\nI think I will have to take half the day off to go get the pins.\nThanks olegc! Now, dumb question, is west the DTD side or the Harbor Blvd side?\nI don't remembering entering the contest for this, but obviously, I must have. I got my email the other day too. I'm not sure if I'll be going up just for this, since we're already going up on Sunday for our ST Preview.\nThe pin looks pretty cool!\nYea, I know. But I do have a day job, so I am going early and hopefully getting out of there early to get back to work!\nJust left DLR. Got 2 of the pins I posted above but those aren't the ones that you needed a wristband for. Those were only passholder exclusive ones. The opening day pins are different. I will post a picture later.\nTotally didn't notice that the pins were by lottery only so I never signed up. Dangit.\nAfter 1:00 PM Today they are open for sale to the public.\nI very much agree. I said it was sketchy when we walked in... I think it was part of the old rocket rods line? Underneath the little green men store.", "version": "v0"}

In order for an image to be successful it needs to resonate with people and this means that whether you are taking a photo of wildlife, a macro shot of a plant, a landscape or a traditional portrait, it needs to be something that reflects emotion. When an image instantly connects with people it can have staying power and get recognized. Look for common connections in your frames and consider the impact that capturing a specific emotion could have with someone. When you look through the camera lens and feel an overall sense of calm and serenity, it\u2019s very likely that someone else viewing the photo that comes out of that scene will feel the same way.\nPlace: The setting of a photograph needs to tell a story as well. Iconic places and scenes that look otherworldly often do well at photography competitions because there places that seem full of wonderment. Work it carefully crafting a scene with lighting, with familiarity and more. It\u2019s incredible the difference that a place can make on the look of a photograph. A great example could be taking a portrait of someone on a cliff overlooking the ocean versus taking that same photo in a studio in editing the background in. The place can help to convey more emotion and although it can be challenging to work on different locations, it leads to better photographs. When you are telling a story you need to make sure that you are getting the scene right and this means taking a special emphasis with every place you are taking photos.\nProp: A prop can tell a story whether it is a favorite teddy bear, a plant, a special sweater or even a sign. Introducing props for an image can help to elevate the story and really improve the quality of the photo with some clever placement. You could consider bringing in props to a landscape shot or even introducing props to a portrait to showcase more of the personality that a portrait subject may have. Letting people pick out their own props is a fantastic way to expand on the story of a photograph and to improve the quality of an image. A simple portrait can very quickly turn into something completely unique and much livelier with a prop or a few props.\nProduction value: The production value as a photographer ultimately is a tool that will help you to tell your story. Picking up a camera where you can adjust focus and aperture settings can be important. Being able to frame the area of the shot that you want to capture, getting the soft lighting and even focusing in on elements of the background can give you more control on the type of story you want to tell. Production value is often something that takes an investment but through the help of editing software and by improving some of your gear, you can work at telling a story with better production value. Even a few small considerations like checking lighting level and using the rule of thirds on your smart phone camera will help you to build a better quality image in terms of production value.\nKeep these top four properties in mind when you are trying to tell a story with your images as a photographer.\n\u2039 Why telling a story is so important?", "version": "v0"}

The main goal is to enable African women researchers and scientists to tackle the great challenges faced by Africa through research in Health and biomedicine, agriculture and food security, water, energy and climate change, mathematics, Information and Communication Technologies as well as Economic Sciences. Women\u2019s lives are significantly affected by the repercussions of uncontrolled development; however, social, structural and economic barriers limit their capacity to tackle the great challenges faced by the continent. The gender disparities in science and technology in both the public and private spheres affect Africa\u2019s population as a whole. Narrowing this gap, which has severe consequences on the balanced and sustainable development of African countries, is vital to achieve long-term progress and equal growing. The programme\u00b4s ultimate goal is to enable African women researchers to play a leading role in the transition of Africa to a knowledge-based and innovationled economy through research that can be transferred into products, processes, services and technologies having impact on people\u00b4s lives. To achieve this ambitious goal, FMxA collaborates with the Spanish Centres of Excellence, whose prestige is unanimously recognized throughout Spain and internationally, thereby ensuring excellence in scientific research in various fields. Our associated research centres are in this 3rd edition are: the Institute of Photonic Sciences (ICFO, http://www.icfo.eu ), the Spanish National Centre for Biotechnology (CNB, http://www.cnb.csic.es) the Institute of Mathematical Sciences (ICMAT, http://www.icmat.es), the Centre for Genomic Regulation (www.crg.es), the Barcelona Graduate School of Economics (http://www.barcelonagse.eu), Vall d\u00b4Hebron Institut de Recerca (VHIR, http://en.vhir.org ), Institute for Neuroscience (IN, in.umh.es), Kronikgune Research Center (www.kronikgune.org/en/), Biocruces (bc) ( www.biocruces.com), DeustoTech (http://deustotech.deusto.es/). Each of the ten centres will host 1 senior woman researcher for a six-month fellowship. Applications will be subjected to a rigorous selection process, evaluating the academic merits and leadership of the applicants as well as the scientific quality and expected impact of their research projects. Selected candidates will receive training and integration in a dynamic, multidisciplinary and highly competitive working team, where they will be able to develop their research projects and acquire complementary skills, empowering them to transfer their research results into tangible economic and social benefits.", "version": "v0"}

Specifically, once the statutory limit of the license is reached, no additional contract balance above that limit may be recovered.\nOur analysis begins with the N.C. General Statutes, specifically Chapter 87-10, which states, in pertinent part, that \u201cthe holder of a limited license shall be entitled to act as general contractor for any single project with a value of up to five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000)[.]\u201d We also need to bear in mind that in 1983, the North Carolina Supreme Court adopted the rule that \u201ca contract illegally entered into by an unlicensed general construction contractor is unenforceable by the contractor. It cannot be validated by the contractor\u2019s subsequent procurement of a license.\u201d Brady v. Fulghum, 309 N.C. 580, 586, 308 S.E.2d 327, 331 (1983).\nBased solely on the cited language of Chapter 87-10 and the general rule expressed in the Brady decision, it would be tempting to conclude that a contract entered into in excess of the statutory limit is illegal, void and therefore unenforceable in a court of law as of the moment the contract is signed. Fortunately, however, that is not how subsequent appellate decisions have handled the situation.\nIn Sample v. Morgan, a contractor with a $125,000 limited license (that was the statutory limit back in the early \u201980\u2019s) entered into a construction contract for $115,967.81, and subsequently entered into change orders with the owner that brought the final construction cost to about $130,000, or $5,000 greater than the limited license. The N.C. Supreme Court held that \u201cuntil [contractor] exceeded the allowable limit of his license, he was not acting in violation of G.S. [Section] 87-10.\u201d 311 N.C. 717, 723, 319 S.E.2d 607, 611 (1984).\nSimilarly, in Dellinger v. Michal, the contractor was licensed up to $175,000 (the statutory limit in the mid \u201980\u2019s) when the contract was executed. Two months later, it secured an unlimited license. Construction began just before the licensure upgrade, and the contractor had only performed $2,800 in work before its license became unlimited. Ruling that general contractors are only entitled to recover up to that amount authorized by their limited licenses, the N.C. Court of Appeals (\u201cCOA\u201d) permitted the contractor to seek payment for its work, since the value of the work it had performed had never exceeded the limit of its license. 92 N.C. App. 744, 375 S.E.2d 698 (1989).\nThe Dellinger rule was upheld by the COA on March 20, 2012 in the unpublished decision McK Enterprises, LLC v. Levi. In that case, the contractor\u2019s limited license permitted it to perform work up to $350,000, but the contract it entered into with the owners was for the lump sum price of $439,141.43. When the bank that was financing the project discovered the issue, it required the owners to sign an acknowledgment that the contract price exceeded the contractor\u2019s license. The contractor and the owners then entered into a modified contract that was identical to the first, except the cost-risk framework was changed from lump-sum to cost-plus (with a 15% fee). As the COA noted, both parties anticipated at the time this modified contract was executed that total costs would exceed the limit of the contractor\u2019s license.\nAs of the end of September 2007, the contractor had performed work valued at $219,581.82 \u2014 well within its $350,000 single project limit. On October 1, 2007, an amendment to Section 87-10 of the General Statutes went into effect, increasing the contractor\u2019s $350,000 limit to $500,000 (the current limit). The final value of contractor\u2019s work was $505,269.12, or about $5,000 more than the amended limit to the contractor\u2019s license. Relying on the rule in Dellinger, the COA held that the contractor was entitled to recover $500,000, but couldn\u2019t recover the rest.\nThe takeaway? If you sign a contract in excess of your limited general contractor\u2019s license, the courts are not likely to consider it illegal, void and/or unenforceable from Day 1, meaning you can force an owner to pay you for your work, at least to a point. That\u2019s the good news. Now the bad: once you hit the current $500,000 limit, the courts are not likely to allow you to recover a penny more. McK Enterprises, LLC lucked out when the General Assembly increased the then-existing license limit from $350,000 to $500,000 during the project, but you can\u2019t rely on that kind of good fortune when you sign on the dotted line. The far more prudent course is to execute contracts within your limit. If you do otherwise, you\u2019ll either need to upgrade to an unlimited license before hitting the statutory ceiling or hope for a limit increase by the state legislature in order to collect anything in excess of your current limitation.", "version": "v0"}

The island is also surrounded by beautiful coral reefs.\nSadly, many of those beautiful coral reefs have been experiencing a disaster called coral bleaching for years.\nHere are the healthy and vibrant corals of the ocean.\nCorals house small fish and protect many of them from their bigger predators. There are many beautiful corals with the colors; red, purple, pink, orange, and yellow.\nYabiji (yah-bi-ji) is made of more than 100 coral reefs located near Ikema Island. It is the largest coral reef group in Japan.\nUsually, the corals are underwater, but they appear above the ocean a couple of times during the spring tide.\nYabiji is one of the most popular tourist spots in Miyako island. Yabiji is called \"Illusional Land\" because of their rare appearance or \"Flower Garden of the Ocean\" because of their color and variety.\nDuring the second week of April, the spring tide sweeps in when the Sun and Moon align with the earth. This causes their gravitational pull to become the greatest in the year.\nDue to the gravitational force affecting the tides, the level of water surrounding the Yabiji atoll becomes very low, to the point where the whole atoll emerges from the ocean.\nThis is the reason why the Yabiji is called the \u2018Illusional Land\u2019. Unfortunately, these illusionary extravaganzas of the ocean are often threatened during their time on the surface.\nEach year when the spring tide arrives, many tourists visit those Yabiji atolls to take part in some sightseeing activities. While this may seem like an innocent act of observing the pieces of the atoll close up, what the tourists are doing is stepping foot onto the Yabiji and damaging the corals.\nThe Miyakojima Tourist Association is saying that \u201cCoral walk is a controlled landing excursion that only takes place for a few days\u201d, which also translates to the fact that the Okinawa prefectural government and the City of Miyakojima are allowing this to happen.\nDuring these seemingly insignificant three days, there are about 1,500 to 1,800 tourists walking on the tops of the corals for one to two hours.\nThinking about the deep bruising and the actual rate of growth of the corals, even a couple of days a year can be critical.\nDue to copyright infringements, we cannot show you the pictures on this website, but you can see the many pictures of the tour activities that take place on the coral reefs of Japanese Google image page.\nIt is our proposition to stop the \u201cLanding excursion tours on the corals (Coral Walk) \u201d immediately and all of the tourist activities should be limited to only \u201cobserve by ship\u201d.\nHere are the dead corals that are washed onto the shore.\nHow does coral bleaching happen?\nWhen the sea temperature rises 2\u00b0C above normal, the corals get damaged.\nThis is the most common way for coral bleaching.\nAs the corals' worst enemy, the acanthaster starfish has the corals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, wiping out whole populations of coral reefs. One acanthaster starfish can eat up to 5-13 square miles of coral reefs per year! During periods of abnormally rapid growth, the large groups of acanthaster starfish move together and spread across the surface of coral reefs.\nFarmers use chemical fertilizers and pesticides to protect sugar cane fields from disease. Unfortunately, those chemicals flow into the ocean with rain water and weakens the corals.\nTourism related activities are often a big threat to the coral reefs.\nurgently be stopped as stated on this page.\nresult in further destruction on the coral reef and the surrounding ecosystem.\nAn unbelievable amount of trash has also been deliberately thrown throughout the islands.\nfarming and fishing were dumped illegally last year.\nThe corals you see in this video are from the project, \"Save the Beach Assets\". All corals were made with water soluble glue and have been returned to their proper beaches after being photographed. Enjoy!\nCopyright \u00a9 2010 - 2015 Miyakojima Kids Net.

From the dark state, very small populations of (ideally) fluorophore are returned to an emissive state, excited, and detected. However, in order to be identified, emission profile must exhibit minimal overlap in each image. The centroid position of each identified molecule is statistically fitted, most often to a Gaussian function, and with a level of precision scaling with the number of detected photons.

The theme of the contest was \u2018elementary\u2019 building. Elementary building can be looked at from different angles. It could be a cheaper way of building (more economical). Or maybe the word \u2018elementary\u2019 was to mean the opposite of complex. Complex building often means that many varieties must be constructed that are establish within democratic processes. Think for instance of the often requested thematic experiences. Complexity could mean an increase in costs. A more economical way of building (energy saving, ingenuity etc.) appealed to us, but the opposite of complex building was not of interest. Elementary and complex are not words of a theme that could give direction to a design process.\nThe design was to be energy efficient. This was achieved by looking at installation technique in another way.\nIn the twentieth century a lot of installation technique is added to the building process. Around 1900 this was practically non-existent. Now, installation technique makes up thirty to forty percent of the building costs. Furthermore, pipes and building construction these days are complexly interwoven. The building process has become more complex and chaotic. Mutual dependence on partial processes during construction must be minimized. It is attempted to disconnect and unravel the installation technique as much as possible from the design process in relation to the architectural parts. Pipes can be installed in a new and simple way. More pre-fabricated material is used.\nThe advantages are: efficiency of the building process, possibility for size reduction and energy reduction.\nThe bearing column is a module of installation technique and spatial partition. The user elements include bath, douche, toilet, kitchen and stairs. The hidden areas in the columns are for pipes for rainwater and sewage. Flexible pipes make this a possibility. The columns can be rotated and offer the user the possibility to create their own space and to adjust it at a later time. The dwelling can be expanded by adding a quarter of the existing house. A quarter house is a standard column with a modular unit which can be provided with extra user facilities.\nThe architectonical space is determined by the installation technique. Residents can answer to this. For this dwelling, feedback means: lay-outs that influence each other and react to the free energy. In Palladio Feedback the free energy returns from the Unavowable Community to our project. Sun, wind and water are seen technologically in this project. Free energy offers the possibility to make the use of the dwelling more economical. This means less energy consumption and a smaller footprint in the future.\nThe footprint is a global calculation model, in which materials, energy etc. and production are taken into account, so per product (a brick or house) or per individual the personal footprint can be calculated. With this footprint it is useful to make comparisons to other products in ecological sense.\nThe end result shows that it is not about improvement of quality in the office projects, with words such as: flexibility, specific areas, thematic areas, but about the spatial change as a result of bearing words that will guide the future: free energy and energy savings.", "version": "v0"}

My Review Uncovers The Truth About It!\nIf you\u2019ve heard about My Online Daily Income claiming to pay it\u2019s members $10k per day, you must be thinking whether it\u2019s really true or just another rip-off like many others. Can a person really make $10K online, in one day? They make these assertions about all this money you can make with their program, but all these claims sound too good to be true.\nThe system seems to be really easy but making money off this system isn\u2019t actually as easy as it looks. You must be extremely careful while looking for chances to make money online because there are a massive number of websites that claim you can earn a nice amount of money on their system but don\u2019t offer you what they promise. The only way to know if My Online Daily Income is a scam or not is to dig in deeper and reach the facts.\nBy the end of this My Online Daily Income review, you will be able to decide for yourself what this system requires you to do if it is a reliable source of income and how it actually works. Read the review to find out if their claims are true or if it\u2019s really just a scam.\nWhat Exactly Is My Online Daily Income?\nAfter looking further into the system, I\u2019ve found a lot of information about how the users of the system actually earn money from it and in this My Online Daily Income review I\u2019ll also shed light on whether the system is trustworthy or not.\nUPDATE: Originally when I wrote this review the My Online Daily Income system was tricking it\u2019s visitors to purchasing an expensive program called MOBE, however MOBE has since been shut down by the FTC & now the My Online Daily Income site is selling an old eBook about making money on eBay. Despite the program changing my verdict below still remains the same.\nMy Online Daily Income is apparently a system where you can make $10k in one day. After some time you\u2019ll be a millionaire, and all that money will allegedly be made online! But can you really trust these claims? Or will this turn out to be a scam like many others?\nMy Online Daily Income is not a real system. In order to identify if a system is real, you will need to buy into it and take a look at what lies on the other side. This is the tricky part because you can only see the false claims about products/systems on the internet until you pay for it, and only then you come to know what it really is. Sometimes, what the system claims isn\u2019t true at all, and when you buy into it, you find yourself in a completely different platform or with a substandard product.\nThe video on the website is exactly the same as the video used on several other systems that make similar claims, for example, My Online Business, Find A Job Now, 7 Figure Franchise and many more. It\u2019s hard to know who to trust when working on the internet, but this review will definitely help you decide what to do.\nHow Does My Online Daily Income Work?\nAll these scam systems act as facade for the primary veiled system that they don\u2019t want you to know about. This is the reason why they use different names but the same video for promotion. The claims about earning $10k/day can only be made by high ticket systems. Only these kind of systems can offer you such a generous amount of commission. One of the few high ticket programs (Digital Altitude) was shut down by FTC this year. You will likely be expected to pay thousands of dollars out of your own pocket if you want to make commissions from these products, that use licensing rights models of MOBE.\nBasically, whenever you buy these products from a high-ticket website, the person behind the website will earn a commission for the sale. Therefore, these products are not cheap. Once you have bought the product, you will be expected to do the same thing to deceive other people into the same scam. You can put this website template on a number of other domains to hoax people into thinking that it\u2019s a platform where you can earn money. You can get the product at a price rate of 2.5 times of what you will earn, for example, if they tell you that you can earn $1,000, that means you will have to pay $2,500.\nAll this detail can also be found on the MOBE Certified Consultant Membership Fees page (which I\u2019ve screen-shotted and placed below this paragraph). These systems push you into using paid advertising in order to get more traffic and audience to your template websites. You\u2019ll have to spend thousands of dollars on advertising because you\u2019ll need to address a large group of people, in which only a few will be able to afford the high prices of these products. The system claims that you will be assisted by a mentor or a coach, but these are merely sales reps who get a commission when you buy the product.\nI personally am not in favour of this system because you are not creating anything of value, instead, you trick people into buying something to get commission for yourself. The only thing this system allows you to do is pass money around from new members to existing members through these expensive products. High ticket programs are high risk and FTC has already shut down one of them. One day you might find out that all your money just went down the drain.\nAnd as I mentioned at the start of this review MOBE (which was being promoted by this My Online Daily Income program) has now also been shut down by the FTC \u2013 that\u2019s why the website is now selling an old eBook about making money from eBay instead.\nMy Verdict \u2013 Is My Online Daily Income a Scam?\nMy Online Daily Income is definitely a scam. It is not a real system, but a cover up of another system that tricks people into buying their ridiculously expensive products & therefore I won\u2019t be recommending it to you.\nOne person after buying the product can use multiple domains to talk people into buying the overly priced product and receive commissions on every sale. There are a number of cover up systems for the same product (some of which I talked about earlier in this review), and these high ticket programs in general are a very \u201ctricky\u201d business.\nAfter reading all the claims and seeing the reality of the system, I would certainly not recommend anyone to use this system because as far as I\u2019m concerned the My Online Daily Income Scam rumours are indeed true!\nIf you were hoping to make money with it you don\u2019t have to be disheartened though because there are plenty of legitimate programs that will actually help you make money online, such as Wealthy Affiliate for example which is actually one of my all-time top recommended programs.\nIs Passive Paychecks a Scam?

Oasis announced $45 million in funding this week, from a mixture of big Silicon Valley VC funds and cryptocurrency investors. Song and one of her cofounders have already tested some of their ideas by helping install new privacy safeguards at Uber, the ride-hailing unicorn whose troubled past includes security incidents.\nOasis Labs cofounders, left to right: chief privacy officer Noah Johnson, chief operating officer Bobby Jaros, chief executive Dawn Song, and chief technical officer Raymond Cheng.\nIn 2014, Uber was rocked by allegations that executives and employees spied on customer movements, using tools such as a map dubbed \u201cGod View.\u201d Two years later, the company settled with New York state\u2019s attorney general and promised to protect rider location data. Oasis grew in part from a 2017 project in which Song and two grad students, one of whom became a cofounder of the Berkeley startup, helped Uber add a more sophisticated privacy safety net.\nThe Berkeley researchers helped build and deploy an open source tool that limits how much employees can learn about individual customers by analyzing rider data. It\u2019s based on a technique called differential privacy, designed to protect individuals\u2019 identity even when data allegedly has been anonymized. It\u2019s also used by Apple to collect data from iPhones without risking customer privacy. In Uber\u2019s system, employees can query a database, for example, to summarize recent rides in a particular area. Behind the scenes, algorithms assess the risk that the request will leak information about individuals, and they inject random noise into the data to neutralize that risk. Ask about recent rides in a large city, and little or no noise will be needed; ask the same for a specific location, say the White House, and much more randomness will be added to obscure traces that might represent specific individuals.\nUber\u2019s differential privacy software doesn\u2019t use a blockchain, a kind of digital records system guarded by cryptography that can limit and log who makes changes or additions. Song says privacy and security systems can be much stronger if they do. We must take Uber\u2019s word that the company has deployed its differential privacy system correctly, for example. Companies that build privacy or security systems plugged into Oasis Labs\u2019 blockchain will be able to provide cryptographic assurances to one another, or their customers, that their systems are doing what was promised, says Song. She describes Oasis Labs as trying to provide the security and privacy infrastructure that the internet is lacking\u2014and for which we are paying a price.\nOasis Labs\u2019 platform can also host small programs, dubbed smart contracts, which can mediate transactions between different people or companies. That makes it similar to ethereum, the second most valuable cryptocurrency system. But Oasis Labs\u2019 blockchain is specifically designed to enable security applications and builds on Berkeley research that Song says makes the system more scalable and practical than existing blockchains.\nSong says her company is talking with organizations in healthcare, finance, and ecommerce hoping to make use of the Oasis platform when it fully launches, probably next year. One large ecommerce company is interested in building internal privacy controls like Uber\u2019s, for example, and sharing more supply chain data with partners while protecting commercially sensitive information. Another project is building a way for health patients to donate medical data for machine learning research. Oasis\u2019 technology will be used to assure patients that their data can\u2019t be diverted for other uses. For the ultra-paranoid, Oasis plans to integrate its software with an open source security chip in development by Berkeley and MIT, similar to the chip that underpins the iPhone\u2019s security, to protect crucial smart contracts against meddling.\nOasis Labs is launching at a time when blockchain projects have some credibility issues. The total value of all cryptocurrencies is estimated at more than $250 billion, and venture investors sank more than $1 billion into blockchain startups last year, according to CB Insights. But cryptocurrencies aren\u2019t widely used and are blighted by scammers, thieves, and poor security. Corporate blockchain projects have delivered more hot air and hype than practical technology.\nSong says the hype around blockchain and lurid adventures of some devotees distract from a genuine opportunity to remake the fundamentals of how computers serve us. \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t throw the baby out with the bathwater,\u201d she says.\nChristian Catalini, a professor at MIT Sloan School of Management, says Song isn\u2019t the only computer science deep thinker who feels that way. \u201cMore talent from academia has been moving into the market,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a new trend.\u201d Researchers from Johns Hopkins and MIT, for example, are contributing to the development of ZCash, a cryptocurrency designed to offer fully anonymous digital transactions, something Bitcoin does not. JP Morgan is partnering with the project, saying anonymity could help companies keep their finances more private. Last year professors from Cornell and Northwestern launched a startup called bloXroute Labs to make cryptocurrencies more scalable, a problem that has plagued bitcoin and ethereum.", "version": "v0"}

The following section describes the details.\nselected group, then pocket the eight, to win the game. On every shot if a player pockets the eight, he loses the game.\n1.You pocket the cue ball or your opponent's balls.\n2.When you shoot, the cue ball fails to hit any ball in your group first.\n3.When you shoot, you neither pocket a ball nor make any ball hit a cushion.\nNote: At least four balls must hit cushions on the first stroke otherwise balls will be re-racked and game will restart.\nBonus Pool is very addictive though it's a single player game.You should not miss it if you want to be a pool shark. Nine balls are racked in a diamond shape, your task is to pocket them all in 20 shots. With one ball pocketed, you score 100, but if you fail to do so, you lose 100 instead. You can get bonus points according to how you pocket the balls.\nis the ball sequence you pocketed. The balls in one bracket were pocketed successively. So, In bracket (4,7,9),there are two 'successive pots',and in (6,2),you have one. For each 'successive pot', you'll get 500 bonus points. So you totally have 3 'successive pots' in your pocketed sequence, then you'll get 500 X 3=1500 bonus points. Now look at the pocketed sequence again, you'll find 4 follows 3,6 follows 5, 7 follows 6 and 8 follows 7,they are called 'sequential pots', for each 'sequential pot', you'll get 500 bonus points too. So, you'll get 500 X 4=2000 bonus points. The total bonus points you'll get is 1500+2000=3500.\nAnother example, if your pocketed sequence is (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9), It means you have 8 'successive pots' and 8 'sequential pots', then you'll get 500 X 8 + 500 X 8 = 8000 bonus!

Players who pocket the cue ball, commit a foul. The player who pockets the nine ball legally wins the game.\nNote: The balls may be pocketed in any order, and in particular the 9-ball may be pocketed at any time. The rule is only that the lowest-numbered ball must be the first one hit, so if you can knock the 1-ball into the 9-ball in such a way that the 9-ball goes into a pocket, you can win a frame very quickly.\nFifteen balls are racked in a triangle and all the object balls are placed randomly.

GEO is a circular orbit 35 786 kilometres above Earth's equator and follows the direction of Earth's rotation. An object in GEO has an orbital period equal to Earth's rotational period, so to ground observers it appears motionless at a fixed position in the sky.\nSatellites in GEO allow permanent communication links to be established by transmitting radio-frequency signals from fixed antennas. These signals are not very different from the signals that are used to broadcast terrestrial television, but usually have a frequency 3\u201350 times higher. The signal is received by the satellite, amplified and transmitted back to Earth, allowing communications between points thousands of kilometres apart.\nA particular property that makes geostationary satellites extremely attractive is their capacity to broadcast. The re-transmitted signal can be picked up by antennas anywhere in the satellite's coverage area. This can be the size of a country, a region, a continent, or even an entire hemisphere. Anyone with an antenna, sometimes as small as 40\u201350 cm in diameter, can become a direct user of the satellite.\nIf an object circles Earth faster than about 8 km/s, it becomes a satellite. It still falls under Earth\u2019s gravitational attraction but the drop is matched by the planet\u2019s curvature as the satellite moves along. It is falling but never reaches the ground.\nThe satellite does not need any propulsion and it will continue to orbit Earth for years. Friction from the thin upper layers of the atmosphere will eventually slow it down and cause it to burn up as it descends into the lower atmosphere.\nIf a satellite is launched with more energy, it travels faster and the radius of its orbit is larger. The larger orbit means that the angular motion of the satellite around Earth is slower. As a reference, the Moon is 380 000 km from Earth and its orbital period is 28 days.\nLow-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites such as the International Space Station and many scientific and observation satellites operate at much lower altitudes: they circle Earth in about 90 minutes at heights of just a few hundred kilometres.\nTelecom satellites can also be placed into LEO, being visible from any one place for 10\u201320 minutes at a time. To guarantee continuity of service, a constellation of tens of satellites would have to be deployed.\nLEO telecom systems may require 48, 66, 77, 80 or even 288 satellites to provide the required services. Several of these systems have been deployed to provide communications to mobile terminals. They use a relatively low frequency, the L- & S-bands (1.5\u20132.5 GHz), which is in the same range as the frequencies used by GSM mobile networks. The fact that the antennas are not very selective is a plus for them: no careful tracking of the satellite is then needed. Also, the low altitude minimises the delay due to signal travel time and reduces the power needed to establish communications.", "version": "v0"}

K-9s (Canines): \u201cWhere\u2019s My Toy?\u201d \u2013 Read Chapter 10 to preview the book now.\nJim Potter is a school resource officer (SRO) in the school system of Hutchinson, Kansas, a relatively small (pop. 47,000) city in the middle of the Midwest. So what could he possibly tell teachers and school resource officers in Philadelphia, Atlanta, or Seattle? Well, it turns out that he could tell them quite a bit. Mainly because Potter\u2019s background, training, education and experience will stack up with the best. Consider the following.\nWith a foundational degree in history from Southern Illinois University as well as a Masters in Education, Potter was also a store security officer, counselor\u2019s aid at a Georgia prison, school teacher and coach in the public schools of Illinois, teacher in a local State of Kansas prison, and a substance abuse counselor.\nSo Jim Potter knows what he is talking about. And what he is talking about in this book are the kinds of problems that every SRO, school teacher and counselor in the country has to deal with at one time or another. Domestic violence in the home. Sexual abuse in both the school and the home. Drug and alcohol addictions. The epidemic of suicides among the young. And the pervasive culture of violence in the schools.\nThese are all weighty topics and yet Jim manages to write about them in clear, concise and at times, even in humorous ways. He is a man of principle, a man of convictions, a man of obvious faith. He cares about kids, and he cares about what kind of adults those kids will become. Most of all, perhaps, he is an educator who knows how to convert the kinds of concerns that all parents and teachers face into concrete courses of action.\nI highly recommend this book for teachers, school resource officers, guidance counselors, social workers, parents, and for anyone else who works with kids of any age.", "version": "v0"}

Rough and ready though it is, the project is ambitious, in striving to bring together questions of reference and denoting, logical form, and ontological \u2013 preferably, ontic \u2013 commitment, with major categories of natural / physical phenomena, such as mixture, chemical transformation, and fluidity in its relation to solidity, along with associated conservation principles. The crucial integrating principle between these two seemingly very different groups of phenomena \u2013 between logico-semantic questions, and questions much closer to the philosophy of chemistry \u2013 is a fairly systematic, and essentially novel, wide-ranging semantical taxonomy of nouns and their occurrences, some of which I classify as \u2018boundless\u2019.\nFurthermore, there is little doubt that this discourse \u2013 a certain fragment of which is brilliantly represented in the predicate calculus \u2013 is not well suited to the formal properties of mass nouns. In fact, this is something of an understatement; for although there are features of mass nouns that can be very well modelled in this calculus, there are some major features that it is impossible to represent within the system. And what to the true votary might seem especially disconcerting is that precisely this latter set of features is displayed by count nouns too. In the case of count nouns, the features reflect an aspect of the underlying abstract concept which I call the numerical neutrality of the object-concept. The fact is \u2013 as is increasingly widely recognised \u2013 that the predicate calculus is an instrument of limited power, even for capturing some major semantic features of count nouns as a general class. Most commonly noted here is the essential singularity of variables (or by the same token, the limitations on predication to its to distributive forms). There are several other such major inadequacies. To the extent that one is interested, with Quine, in ontology, it is certainly arguable that these inadequacies are of no great import. However, when the self-same failure occurs with mass nouns, the ontology here is massively affected, indeed distorted almost beyond recognition. Notwithstanding the obvious historicity of (actual) systems of formal logic, there is a naive but widespread tendency (determined largely by modes of instruction) to view the present system as the ultimate incarnation of reason, descending, as it were, directly from the Platonic heaven of perfect forms. Needless to say, nothing could be further from the plain truth.\nLike count nouns, mass nouns as a general class are an extremely diverse group. And there are many words among the concrete mass nouns, words like \u2018furniture\u2019 and \u2018traffic\u2019, that are not, in any sense I use, words for kinds of stuff or matter. Nevertheless, a specifically metaphysical interest in the denotation of those mass nouns that are in fact words for matter \u2013 words, very roughly, for material stuffs or substances in the chemical sense \u2013 may be naturally characterised as falling under the philosophy of matter. And it is fair to say that the place of matter within metaphysics, and its relationships with the traditional categories of individual substance, property or general attribute and species, genus or kind, have never been very clearly established. Indeed, since the scientific revolution, the ontic category of matter has rarely been examined, or even recognized as such, within philosophy. The ancient and mediaeval worlds faced no such absence of sustained philosophical enquiry into the categories of nature.\nThe doctrine is that all traits of reality worthy of the name can be set down in an idiom of this austere form if in any idiom. It is in spirit a philosophical doctrine of categories.\nThe minds of men in the twentieth century, for whom a belief in the stable identity of objects is part of the ruling mode of thought, must make an effort of science and will to recapture the universal presence of becoming.\nWords for objects, count nouns, are tellingly dubbed by Bloomfield as \u2018bounded\u2019 nouns; whereas it is a central feature of the pre-Socratic view of stuff like air and water that it is boundless. Parenthetically, I should say that I am no more interested in the promotion of what has been called a \u2018stuff ontology\u2019 (whatever that might be) than an in defending an \u2018ontology of things\u2019; \u2018ontologies\u2019 in this sense, as it seems to me, are akin to games of chess. I do however reject the Quinean claim, echoed more recently (and if anything less equivocally) by others, that we have no option but to talk and \u2018think in terms of things\u2019.\nNevertheless, the most serious defect in current thinking on these matters is a defect in our thinking about things. The simple reason why the so-called \u2018problem of mass nouns\u2019 is a problem is that the standard count noun framework is deficient. The problem of mass nouns is a relatively new one within philosophy; and it appears to have come into focus, precisely in the light of Frege\u2019s pre-existing formal framework. The default form of object-talk is taken to be singular, and on such a basis, much of what we say cannot be adequately understood. Correlatively, the shift in perspective I take to be required, to clearly view the structure of the formal landscape, is probably the most challenging aspect of this work. At the same time, the idea that the tail of our most recent form of logic should wag the dog of thought, in general and as such, looks all too much like yet another way of closing off the paths of free enquiry. At the end of the day, the system which effectively excludes matter from ontology, along with the character of its remarkable transformations, is no more, I think, than just another prejudice or dogma \u2013 but a unusually powerful dogma for all that, backed up and reinforced, as it seems to be, by certain inescapable features of the human condition. It is with these conditions that the argument begins.\n1.0 Ontology and life-world. We live and breathe within a network of ideas \u2013 what Quine has called the web of belief, and others, our conceptual structure (framework, scheme). Speaking not of beliefs but words, Quine writes of a \u2018structure of interconnected sentences [as] a single fabric including all sciences, and indeed everything we ever say about the world\u2019. That everything we ever say about the world may be thought of as a single interconnected \u2013 developing and expanding \u2013 totality is surely plausible. But this totality is far from being homogeneous; the structure is composed of distinct elements. Among the basic elements of such a scheme, most fundamental has to be an inferential framework for belief and reasoning, a framework linked, albeit somewhat loosely, to existing formal systems of the predicate calculus. Beyond this, any such scheme, for embodied thinking beings such as we, cannot but include both ontological and epistemic elements \u2013 and in particular, a contrast between \u2018how things look\u2019 and \u2018how they really are\u2019. And in extremely general, highly abstract terms, our beliefs concerning how things really are, are just what make up our ontology.\nThe ontic point of view is an objective point of view, and this is so, because we have no choice but to conceive the world objectively \u2013 as independent of experience, not as merely \u2018data\u2019 for our senses. As the organic, thinking beings that we are, possessed of reason and perception, we cannot avoid the contrast of appearance and reality. And this is no mere fact of human nature; it is the uniquely and compellingly rational explanation for the heterogeneous phenomena of experience themselves. The contrast lays the basis for an explanation of many aspects of the subjective content of perceptual experience in terms of the objective relationship between the way things are, and the way we are as subjects. That the world indeed is the way in which we spontaneously infer it to be \u2013 in accordance with the cognitive distinction we spontaneously draw within perception, between the nature of the objects of perception and the character of appearances, perspectives and points of view \u2013 itself constitutes the explanatory basis of that spontaneous distinction. We are inevitably rationalists of the intellect, and cannot but be realists.\nWhat is sometimes (and often enough pejoratively) called \u2018folk\u2019 ontology, is in fact the theory of a system of objective categories of being. It can in my view make no claims, in cosmic terms, to be inclusive, to embody all that does or could exist, but simply reflects the objective categorial content of human thinking and perceptual experience of things. The system itself is implicit, or embodied, in an enormous mass of experientially grounded, commonplace beliefs about the world, and it is among the missions of philosophy to attempt to make this abstract system of beliefs and categories explicit. That this should be possible in the first place is a function of the fact that thought, unlike experience, is not intrinsically limited or bounded. As such and in itself, its character is free and open; and as involving concepts, is inherently universal \u2013 capable of contemplating the objects of mathematics, the boundless character of time and space, the thought of others, the structure of language, the nature of negation, the nature of the non-existent, the concept of existence itself; and, again, the basic contrast of appearance with reality. It is the task of reason, abstract thought alone and not experience, to isolate, identify, and thereby make objective ontic categories explicit. And rendered thus explicit, ontology is counted as a discipline within the broad domain of metaphysics.\nYet, from the standpoint of the total fabric, there is one element within the scheme \u2013 the counterpart of that domain which may be called the life-world \u2013 that looms uniquely large.\nLinguistically, and hence conceptually, the things in sharpest focus are the things that are public enough to be talked of publicly, common and conspicuous enough to be talked of often, and near enough to sense to be quickly identified and learned by name; it is to these that words apply first and foremost.... our ordinary language of physical things is about as basic as language gets.... Our conceptual firsts are middle-sized, middle-distanced objects.\nmust also be accessible to such means of observation as we have; and, since those means are strictly limited in power, they must collectively have enough diversity, richness, stability and endurance to make possible and natural just that conception of a single unitary framework which we possess. Of the categories of objects which we recognize, only those satisfy these requirements which are, or possess, material bodies... Material bodies constitute the framework.\nIn a nustshell, Quine tells us that our everyday talk of physical objects \u2018is about as basic as language gets\u2019, that the things in sharpest focus, the \u2018conceptual firsts\u2019, are middle-sized bodies, and Strawson similarly maintains that material bodies are what \u2018constitute the framework\u2019 \u2013 that they are, as he also puts it, \u2018the basic or fundamental particulars\u2019 in our overall conceptual scheme.\nNow there is something very plausible, and even true, about these cognate claims. The question is, exactly what? It seems both natural and reasonable to characterise these passages as thumbnail sketches of a central, fundamental feature of our world-view \u2013 our overall perspective or viewpoint, in some fairly literal sense, upon the world at large. What they are surely not, however, are ontic claims in a straightforwardly objective sense. Rather, they are claims about the cognitive frame and contents of the human lebenswelt \u2013 about the kinds or categories that play a central role within the thought, experience and life activity of human beings (and presumably of other creatures much like us elsewhere). That physical objects do in fact constitute an ontic category is not, realistically, contentious: it is rather the significance of claims of \u2018primacy\u2019, \u2018centrality\u2019, and \u2018framework-status\u2019 that are in question; these are claims of an entirely different kind. In effect, I suggest, what both Quine and Strawson highlight, in their remarks about our total scheme of thought, is a vast, essentially pragmatic factor, broadly understood. At bottom, their concern is with the implications of embodiment for thought about the world, since it is our specific form of embodiment itself \u2013 along with the life-supporting environment in which we live and breathe \u2013 that constitutes the ultimate, physiological / organic basis of our lebenswelt, and consequently of our world-view.\nThese accounts are thereby of a piece with Heidegger\u2019s account of our being in the world, which also places central emphasis on our relationships with other bodies; and for Heidegger, it is the concrete physical interaction with these things \u2013 crucially, our treatment of reality as manipulable \u2013 that counts as \u2018basic\u2019. For him, our most intimate relationships with the rest of the world are no mere matter of observation, even less of contemplation, but consist in direct intervention, in the usage and handling of individual tangible objects. Although, therefore, the ontic \u2018point of view\u2019 is an objective point of view, this point of view \u2013 more properly, this conception \u2013 nevertheless exists within the broader frame of reference.\nAs both Quine and Strawson in effect suggest, the life-world forms the framework of the web or scheme itself. And yet, as Quine also remarks, \u2018for all the difficulty of transcending our object-directed pattern of thought, we can examine it well enough from inside.\u2019 Human beings exist in a vastly complex organic relationship with a physical reality which exists, for the most part, independently of them. As living organisms, as the embodied conscious beings we are, we possess a highly specialised physiological system of sensory receptors, filters, and focussing devices, matching our needs, interests and motor capacities, given the conditions in which we find ourselves. The interplay of the perceptual / cognitive system with the vast totality of physical process in the immediate environment, from the flood of neutrinos to the wash of gravity waves, must select out as central just those categories bearing on our particular mode of embodiment and our environmental niche. The dimensions of this highly complex organic relationship naturally include physical and biological factors, along with psychological and cognitive dimensions \u2013 all of which are plainly open to empirical investigation. It is among the tasks of empirical enquiry, along with mathematics and philosophy, to identify, explain, and thereby transcend such elements.\nThe fact is that our cognitive frame of reference and our common point of view are necessary features of our life world \u2013 we are essentially embodied, and there is no other reference-frame; human perceptual experience of an independent reality cannot but be grounded and rooted in a spatio-temporally localised point of view, in which the focus of direct experience \u2013 in stark contrast with that of thought \u2013 can be nothing other than the here and now: our attention is almost unavoidably directed to this, that and the other; and Quine\u2019s individuating, \u2018object-directed pattern of thought\u2019 prevails. Such is life that we are, as both authors rightly note, compellingly preoccupied with local, \u2018middle-sized\u2019 things. And not only is it the case that our experience and presence in the world are essentially local, limited and bounded, but also, to belabour the obvious, the value of experience is by no means purely cognitive. Experience is not only informative; it is characteristically interesting, and typically enjoyable. Though we cannot but be rationalists of the head, we are also, and inescapably, empiricists at heart. We are profoundly immersed in and at home with the rich and deeply engaging world of the senses, with sights and scenes, sounds and colours, tastes and touches; and home is surely where the heart is.\nInsofar as it is shaped by our experience \u2013 which is, in a word, massively \u2013 our world-view is itself not merely cognitive. Hence in direct proportion to the scope and depth of influence of the pragmatic framework, the task of an objective, independent ontic account becomes more challenging. The scheme embodies or reflects the life-world; but at the same time, being ontically realistic, it cannot but transcend it. The relationship of reason to experience cannot then be entirely harmonious. The possibility of tension, strain and stress (if not outright distortion or confusion) between the poles of our embodied, experience-saturated particularity and our inbuilt, viewpoint-independent realism cannot be counted out. The tensions are sometimes expressed as ontic disputes \u2013 disputes about, just for instance, the nature of colour, or as questions about the relationship between \u2018is red\u2019 and \u2018looks red\u2019 \u2013 and are also present in such simple facts as this, that there are often two ways of describing appearances themselves. How are we to describe the appearance of the surface of a circular or square table, for example, if not viewed from a central position perpendicular to the surface \u2013 round or not, square or not? Indeed, the evidence suggests that insofar as ontic categories are concerned, there may be deep distorting pressures from the life world.\nEverything else is either said of primary substances as subjects, or in them as subjects ... if primary substances did not exist, it would be impossible for anything else to exist.\nThe ontic thesis is, indeed, a logico-semantic thesis: primary substances are presented as the logically primary objects of both reference and predication; a primary substance is described as \u2018this-something\u2019, such that everything else (general attributes, relations, etc.) is either ultimately predicated of such objects, or has a logico-ontic dependence on them (tropes, or particularized attributes \u2013 the redness of Rudolf\u2019s nose, and suchlike). Aristotle here forges a remarkable equation between being a subject of concrete reference or ostension, and constituting a fundamental element of being: on his account, so it would seem, the basic cosmic principle is precisely isomorphic with a symbolic human act.\nNow it can hardly be said to be intuitively obvious that such phenomena as radiation, gravitational and magnetic fields, gravity waves, the geometrical structure of space-time and indeed the all-encompassing space-time continuum as such, must be counted either as physical objects themselves or as somehow \u2018secondary\u2019 modes of being to such objects. And in any case, Aristotle\u2019s argument appears to beg a crucial question. The claim that primary substances are the basic, independent subjects of predication, whereby everything else is either predicated of or present in them, presupposes that we are somehow already in possession of the exhaustive list of \u2018everything else\u2019. However, Aristotle nowhere provides an argument to the effect that primary substances, along with his small list of items that are \u2018said of primary substances as subjects or in them\u2019, exhaust the general categories of what there is. And as it happens, at least one plausible candidate for ontic status \u2013 the very one of present interest \u2013 is manifestly absent from Aristotle\u2019s list of \u2018everything else\u2019. It is often remarked that matter, material stuff or hyle is nowhere mentioned in the Categories. The suspicion must remain that any supposed logico-ontic primacy of bodies is ultimately epistemic or pragmatic primacy, albeit in a metaphysical or logical disguise.\n1.1 Drawing boundaries: linguistics and mass nouns. So far as the distinctively modern philosophical consciousness is concerned, awareness of the fact that a distinct and sui generis category of matter actually exists in the domain of metaphysics has begun to dawn, so it would seem, only within the past sixty years or thereabouts. This we owe in large part to Otto Jespersen\u2019s achievements in linguistics. It is to Jespersen that we owe our formal recognition of the lexical classes of mass and count nouns, our adoption of the matching terminology of \u2018mass\u2019 and \u2018count\u2019, and especially our growing awareness of the problematic nature of the former category. It is to his introduction and philosophically-coloured examination of the dichotomy of \u2018mass words\u2019 and \u2018thing words\u2019, in the early decades of the 20th Century, that Quine initially refers in Word and Object.\nThere are a great many words which do not call up the idea of some definite thing with a certain shape or precise limits. I call these \u2018mass-words\u2019; they may be either material, in which case they denote some substance in itself independent of form, such as silver, quicksilver, water, butter, gas, air, etc., or else immaterial, such as leisure, music, traffic, success, tact, commonsense, and ... satisfaction, admiration, refinement, from verbs, or ... restlessness, justice, safety, constancy, from adjectives.\nJust what sort of an idea is that of a substance such as water, air, or butter \u2013 a substance \u2018in itself, and independent of form\u2019, what Jespersen calls an uncountable \u2013 and what exactly is its metaphysical significance? First and foremost, it is crucial to acknowledge that like count nouns, mass nouns are an extremely diverse group; and while there is a reasonably clear semantical distinction between the two groups, it is evident that mass nouns do not as such denote an ontic category distinct from that of countables or things. There is a sense in which, as Quine puts it, the contrast is \u2018in the words\u2019; it is no more than syntactic and semantic. Whether we refer to knives, forks and spoons as such, or as cutlery, there is no corresponding ontic contrast.\nNevertheless, the contrast between knives and forks, or cutlery, on the one hand, and soup and cheese on the other, is an ontic contrast. It is an ontic contrast either between count and mass nouns, if we opt for \u2018knives and forks\u2019, or between two kinds of mass nouns, if we opt for \u2018cutlery\u2019. Yet mass nouns in general have certain universal properties whose significance emerges perhaps most clearly in such cases. In particular, the absence of \u2018a certain shape or precise limits\u2019 \u2013 the concept, in effect, of a boundary \u2013 is a feature equally of cutlery, of flour, and of wine. And precisely because of this absence of a boundary or limit, it is not only such stuff as flour and wine, but also such things as knives, forks and spoons, that may be said to be scattered all over the place: the concepts of both multitude and mass are universally, as I shall say, non-unitary or non-singular, and so impose no boundaries or limits on their application. Hence while mass nouns are sometimes contrasted with count nouns in terms of the idea of failing to draw boundaries, the fact is that this \u2018failure\u2019 is no less relevant to count nouns, when used in plural contexts. Individually, the ideas of knives, forks and spoons are the ideas of determinate things with specific shapes or precise limits, but collectively, the scatter of knives, forks and spoons needs know no bounds. Bloomfield\u2019s graphic talk of words for discrete things as \u2018bounded\u2019 nouns concerns their application only in the singular; but qua multiplicity, knives and forks \u2013 much like flour and wine \u2013 may be scattered without limits , and are in principle entirely boundless.\nThe intuitive point mentioned by Jespersen \u2013 that the idea of a substance (\u2018in itself and independent of form\u2019) is not (unlike the ideas of chairs and tables, cats and dogs) the idea of a definite thing with certain shapes or precise limits \u2013 is therefore, and in the very simplest way, no more than half the truth. On the basis of Jespersen\u2019s remarks, it might seem that there is a kind of challenge, in grasping the idea of a substance \u2018in itself and independent of form\u2019, precisely because it is not the idea of a definite thing with a certain shape or precise limits. It might seem that for just this reason, the imagination here confronts a certain difficulty or unease. Like the idea of a chair or table, the idea of solid block of ice or butter is one thing; but the idea of a substance in itself and independent of form \u2013 the mere idea of water, gas, air, and so forth \u2013 is quite another. But then, is this idea of a substance in itself and independent of form a mere abstraction? Is it perhaps a condition of adequate imaginings, that what is thus imagined should have a certain shape or limits? However, to ask such questions, or to think of the issue in this manner, is deeply misleading. For just this challenge does not seem to hold for cutlery \u2018outside the box\u2019, or scattered furniture, or jewelry. The challenge, rather, in the case of water, butter and the like, would seem to lie in the absence of individual constituents \u2013 the absence of a corresponding scatterable multiplicity. Both stuff and things, conceived in aggregate, are in principle boundless: the difference is that things are essentially particulate and therefore countable with count nouns, whereas stuff, with matching nouns, is not.\nFurthermore, there is no doubt that within the life world, materials are very commonly present and manifest within the frame of object-dominance. In contrast with the roles of everyday physical objects, the practical roles of materials in our lives are very often, or typically, mediated by something else \u2013 the physical objects themselves. In that sense they are often less immediate, occurring as they commonly do in the form of bounded objects composed of the materials in question; or in cases in which the materials are not themselves the materials of which anything is actually made \u2013 as with dry goods such as sugar, flour and salt, and liquids such as wine and beer \u2013 the materials are neatly packaged, or bottled, by the use of containers, and so, in a different way, do not occur distinct from physical objects. Concerned about identity, we track the ice cube, not the ice; the bottle, not the wine inside it. These are plainly features of the objective environmental situation in which we inevitably find ourselves; our existence is only possible within a situation whereby most matter has long since condensed from hot gases, dust and so forth into the form of discrete solid objects. Indeed it is only where a substance is not solid, and is not playing a role within the life-world \u2013 not bottled or contained \u2013 that the very distinction between materials and physical objects is potentially made manifest within perception. And as it happens, there is only one substance of which this is typically true. Atmospheric air, of course, is both invisible and virtually intangible; but water, while invisible as vapour, condenses from this state and falls visibly and palpably as rain, gathering to flow in rivers, passing through lakes, entering the oceans. And in Part IV, I shall defend the intuitive idea that the relative stability and re-identifiability of many material objects \u2013 the basis of our own and maybe any referential framework \u2013 simply has no analog, where fluid matter is concerned: here, in the nature of the case, there are no landmarks \u2013 no stable, bounded \u2018this-somethings\u2019. In physical theory, materials are arguably more fundamental than bodies \u2013 many properties of bodies derive from those of matter (density, colour, taste, resilience and so forth, although, of course, not size or shape). Hence from a strictly ontic point of view, there is no reason to suppose that the lebenswelt primacy of bodies should be incompatible with a more basic, \u2018boundless\u2019 role for matter.\nquite well before [a child] has mastered the ins and outs of our adult conceptual scheme of mobile enduring physical objects, identical from time to time and place to place.\nonly when the child has got on to the full and proper use of individuative terms like \u2018apple\u2019 that he can properly be said to have taken to using terms as terms, and speaking of objects.\nWater is scattered in discrete pools and glassfuls, and red in discrete objects; still it is just \u2018pool\u2019, \u2018glassful\u2019, and \u2018object\u2019, not \u2018water\u2019 or \u2018red\u2019, that divide their reference.\npersist in breaking reality down somehow into a multiplicity of identifiable and discriminable objects, to be referred to by singular and general terms. We talk so inveterately of objects that to say we do so seems almost to say nothing at all; for how else is there to talk? It is hard to say how else there is to talk ... because we are bound to adapt any alien pattern to our own in the very process of understanding or translating the alien sentences.\nThe implication is clear: \u2018our own pattern\u2019 is object-directed exclusively; and it is at this point that, having remarked on \u2018the difficulty of transcending our object-directed pattern of thought\u2019 Quine continues by suggesting that \u2018we can examine it well enough from inside.\u2019 However when we do so, we discover, dismayingly, that much of it just does not fit the object-directed pattern (as Quine had pointed out above). The overall account thus appears to be \u2013 and as it stands just is \u2013 completely incoherent.\nseems scarcely to affect [mature] people\u2019s attitude toward \u2018water.\u2019 For \u2018water,\u2019 \u2018sugar,\u2019 and the like the category of bulk terms remains, a survival of the pre-individuative phase, ill fitting the dichotomy into general and singular.\nIn this respect, Quine speculates, the species suffers a certain underdevelopment or conceptual / linguistic lag; we may have \u2018in the bulk term a relic, half vestigial and half adapted, of a pre-individuative phase in the evolution of our conceptual scheme\u2019. There is a kind of hiatus between aspects of our conceptual development and the concrete things of everyday experience \u2013 these, after all, are our \u2018conceptual firsts\u2019 and embody the refined apparatus of divided reference. Otherwise viewed, the tension I have remarked between the poles of our embodied, experience-centred particularity and our viewpoint-independent realism is resolved in favour of experience. It is a consequence of the dominance of objects in our life-world and overall conceptual scheme, that whatever does not fit the object-directed pattern cannot have independent recognition as an ontic category. Incoherently, as it would seem, the recognition that the pattern is not in fact all-inclusive somehow constitutes the basis for retrospectively enforcing its all-inclusive rule. Thus contrary to the data which he himself recognises, we are bound, Quine paradoxically insists, to adapt the \u2018alien pattern\u2019 of terms which do not individuate to \u2018our own objectifying pattern\u2019.\nBut now viewed from the standpoint of the internal structure of the web of belief, as I have so roughly sketched it, there is a way of making sense of what Quine says. And the key to this is simply that Quine\u2019s constituent ideas be assigned to separate elements within the web, thereby removing the incoherence; and much the same procedure will be called for in the case of Strawson\u2019s claims. The suggestion that there is here a failure to distinguish between the pragmatic life-world sense in which material objects are primary, central, or fundamental to our conceptual scheme, and a sense in which they might be thought to be objectively, ontically or quasi-logically fundamental, presents itself as a uniquely plausible explanation of Quine\u2019s straightforward incoherence.\nneither contain any part which introduces a particular, nor any expression used in such a way that its use presupposes the use of expressions to introduce particulars.\nBut we can readily enough acknowledge that the introduction of particulars is so fundamental a conceptual step as to leave the primitive pre-particular level of thought as, at most, no more than vestigial in language.\nAnd once again, the incoherence can be avoided, by charitably reassigning talk of the pre-particular or pre-individuative to the ontic element, and the talk of the primacy of objects and of individuation to the life-world. An elucidation and exploration of this ontic element will constitute the central body of this work.\nIn the case of both the writers I have singled out, the vital distinction between the \u2018pragmatic\u2019 life-world / world-view sense in which material objects count as primary, central, or fundamental to our conceptual scheme, and a sense in which they might be thought to be quasi-logically, objectively or ontically fundamental, has been substantially elided or effaced. Strawson, in particular, appears to assimilate what he calls \u2018our ontology\u2019 to the structure of the world as we embodied beings live it, the life-world or our overall conceptual scheme. And yet, at the same time, he follows Aristotle in urging the objective, life-world independent logical primacy, as fundamental subjects of predication, of concrete objects, in which case his remarks about a logically yet more basic level would seem to contradict the claim of primacy. Quine, of course, promotes both pragmatism and the scientific world-view, and so would perhaps, in a different way, hope to reject the very contrast between a human-centred web of belief and an objective or realist ontology.\n2.0 The idea of a singular subject. It is commonly remarked \u2013 both inside philosophy and out \u2013 that \u2018mass nouns lack a plural form\u2019, or \u2018do not pluralize\u2019. As mere comments on English syntax, such remarks are unobjectionable: it is perfectly obvious that in the usage of native speakers, then unless the contest is generic, words like \u2018sugar\u2019, \u2018gold\u2019 and \u2018water\u2019 resist the plurality morpheme \u2018-s\u2019. Typically or often, however, remarks about the absence of a plural form are bearers of a deeper meaning \u2013 not altogether unreasonably, they are understood to mean that mass nouns cannot but be singular, or that they are invariably singular, and that in a semantic sense. In many cases, nouns in English have both semantically singular and plural occurrences, whether they are syntactically marked or not (as with the contrast of \u2018this sheep\u2019 and \u2018these sheep\u2019). Yet in their non-generic uses, mass nouns are incapable of being pluralized, and for just this reason, it is directly concluded that mass nouns are always and only singular.\nGiven any x, if x is some water, then x is liquid H2O\u2019.\nA value of a variable, in sentences such as the above, can only be this or that water; and whatever can be said to be some water can presumably be referred to in this way. In these cases, she notes, variables take values of a special type, values which satisfy the axioms of a mereology or Boolean algebra. And if this is our starting point, we shall certainly be obliged to expand upon the everyday \u2018Aristotelian\u2019 picture of what, in general, concrete objects can be like. Physical reality will then begin to merge with something much like an abstract theory of sets: while singular count nouns typically denote enformed or structured objects \u2013 individual dogs, cats, chairs and tables, galaxies and molecules \u2013 mass nouns then denote objects of a purely mereological type, actually or potentially scattered set-like entities, with parts but without elements or members.\nNow if for the moment we simply accept the singularity hypothesis, and turn to the natural grammar of English, the actual syntax of mass nouns will seem remarkably anomalous, and ought surely to be deeply puzzling. In non-generic contexts, it is true, grammar rules out plural talk of \u2018waters\u2019, \u2018salts\u2019, and so forth. Yet concrete singular constructions \u2013 \u2018a water\u2019 and \u2018a salt\u2019 \u2013 are also counted out. Indeed, mass nouns also reject the quantifiers appropriate to singular contexts (\u2018each\u2019, \u2018every\u2019, etc.); and based on the quantifiers they do accept, it is not just strikingly evident, but even commonly remarked that mass nouns far more closely resemble plural nouns. Alongside \u2018all dogs\u2019, \u2018some dogs\u2019, \u2018more dogs\u2019 and \u2018most dogs\u2019, the phrases \u2018all water\u2019, \u2018some water\u2019, \u2018more water\u2019 and \u2018most water\u2019 are well formed \u2013 while, once again, the singular constructions are ruled out. In attempting to theorize the semantic content of mass nouns, it seems especially odd that a few syntactic phenomenon, and chiefly, the absence of a plurality morpheme, should prevail over a mass of non-singular syntactic data. The plain fact is that the standard semantic model for mass nouns provides no explanation whatsoever for these phenomena; they are treated as the merest anomalies.\nA plausible explanation is, however, available, and my initial aim is to very briefly lay it out. From the premise that \u2018mass nouns do not pluralize\u2019 to the conclusion that they are invariably singular, there is a key implied assumption \u2013 that nouns or their occurrences must, always, be semantically either singular or plural. The assumption, I suggest, is simply false; and once abandoned, the otherwise anomalous behaviour of mass nouns becomes manifestly intelligible. Naturally, there is a certain resistance to letting go of the assumption, since doing so rests upon acknowledging a major hiatus between the existing count-noun framework and the relevant data-set. Further, to complicate matters somewhat, there is real and significant overlap between the scope of the count noun paradigm and the semantic features of mass nouns \u2013 between, e.g., the semantics of singular count nouns, and the semantics of non-plural mass nouns. And in the nature of the case, this overlap is such as to give those who rely on the paradigm the hope \u2013 perhaps even the expectation \u2013 that no such hiatus really exists.\nPurely insofar as the semantics of mass nouns are concerned \u2013 as against the analytic structure diagrammed above \u2013 Jespersen\u2019s account precisely coincides with this. In one surprisingly little-quoted comment, Jespersen states outright that by comparison with countables or thing-words, \u2018Mass-words are totally different, logically they are neither singular nor plural, because what they stand for is not countable\u2019. It is in this connection that Jespersen writes of the need for an ideal language, \u2018constructed on purely logical principles\u2019. And in such a language, he suggests, a distinctive logical form would be called for, \u2018when we left the world of countables (such as houses, horses, days, miles, sounds, words, crimes, plans, mistakes, etc.) and got to the world of uncountables\u2019. Jespersens\u2019s seminal but neglected remarks are no less cryptic than they are intriguing.\nhas natural semantic units that are the same as those of singular discourse, but stuff discourse has no natural semantic units, and reference and predication seem to proceed on a different model than that of an individual and a property.\nshould not expect a successful reduction to singular reference and singular predication, something that the application of traditional first-order logic would require. When we say that water surrounds our island, our discourse is not singular discourse (about an individual) and is not plural discourse (about some individuals); we have no single individual or any identified individuals that we refer to when we use \u2018water\u2019.\nWe have, in short, no individuals when using \u2018water\u2019, and to this extent, McKay and I are in complete agreement on both semantics and ontology.\n2.1 The intimate kinship of mass and count nouns. On the bold assumption, then, that the tableau has it right, it will be simply incorrect to talk about the contrast between mass and count nouns \u2013 as if there were just one, and furthermore, one which defined the entire relationship between the categories. In fact, in anything other than purely morphosyntactic terms, speaking as if a contrast is what matters is profoundly misleading. Quite apart from the point that there is not a single contrast on display between these nouns \u2013 but rather, two \u2013 the fact is that, quite crucially, the semantic commonalities between the groups are no less fundamental than the differences. Mass nouns share with plural count nouns the feature of non-singularity; and share with singular count nouns the feature of non-plurality. Hence, among other things, the so-called mass / count contrast over \u2018cumulative reference\u2019 is by no means the contrast it is said to be, since Quine\u2019s cumulative principle applies to both: adding water to water results only in more water; just so, adding apples to apples results only in more apples. Again, the non-singularity of both mass nouns and plurals is directly reflected in their common quantifiers. While non-count nouns, like plurals, never associate with quantifiers used in singular contexts, those non-singular quantifiers which are not essentially plural are shared. Thus unlike \u2018many\u2019, the quantifiers \u2018all\u2019, \u2018some\u2019, and \u2018most\u2019, and in most of its occurrences, \u2018any\u2019, are shared by mass nouns and non-singular CNs alike. Arguably then, the key contrast here is not so much that of count and mass nouns, as that of singular and non-singular nouns, whether count or non-count. It seems vital to recognize the centrality of non-singularity as such, since not only the forms of predication in general, but also the lexical aspect-related concepts of change or process of particular relevance to mass nouns, and the behaviour of bare nouns in general, are best understood when associated with non-singular nouns as an inclusive class; or so I argue in the sequel. The \u2018problem of mass nouns\u2019, so I\u2019ll be urging, is misleadingly so-called: the problem is no less a problem of non-singularity \u2013 and for both the NP and the VP features of a sentence \u2013 than of mass nouns or uncountability as such.\nBut why then, it may be asked, are the referential determiners for mass nouns morphologically indistinguishable from semantically singular expressions? Why should \u2018this water\u2019 look exactly like \u2018this dog\u2019? As Leech notes, syntax \u2018is much less rich in dimensions of contrast than is semantics\u2019, and the point is illustrated in this morphosyntactic parallel. There are three semantic categories here (singular, plural, and non-count) but the syntax of demonstratives can only take two forms, and to understand their taxonomy, we need a bifold contrast merely of the plural and non-plural \u2013 a class encompassing the singular along with the non-count. Since \u2018water\u2019 is itself non-plural \u2013 but not thereby semantically singular \u2013 the water in a glass can only be referred to as \u2018this water\u2019. Quantificational differences are marked in English, but English syntax marks no contrast, in referential contexts, between singular and non-plural \u2013 potentially thereby inviting a fateful conflation of the two. Notice here also the significance of the contrast between the use of rigid and non-rigid designators in such a non-singular context. It is not implausible to suppose that demonstrative reference \u2013 this water \u2013 designates a determinate amount of water, and that must, strictly speaking, lose its identity, and thereby cease to exist, if it is in the least amount diminished. But the water in a glass, thus denoted \u2013 whatever liquid water that happens to be \u2013 can for example be said to slowly evaporate, and plainly cannot, as it evaporates, remain the same water from one moment to the next; but at the same time, the water, thus denoted, cannot be said to cease to be until all of it has ceased to be.\nUnsurprisingly, therefore, the contrast of \u2018this water\u2019 and \u2018this dog\u2019 runs deep. Notwithstanding the fact that talk of the same stuff of some specific kind is prima facie meaningful, this is not to say that words like \u2018water\u2019 give a criterion of identity for whatever may be designated. Quite the contrary: as Quine has noted, they do not. Insofar as mass nouns occur in seemingly referential contents, their mode of reference diverges substantially from that of reference which is singular. And the explanation of this phenomenon, so I\u2019ll urge, is to be found in the fact that mass nouns are not essentially referential in the first place.\nContrast then the semantic character of reference to an individual \u2013 an individual dog, for instance \u2013 with that of reference to some water. To grasp the concept or meaning content of the general count noun \u2018dog\u2019 is to grasp the kind-identity criteria for dogs (such as they may be). The identity of some particular individual dog \u2013 this or that dog \u2013 can then be specified by combining the use of the general term with the use of a (non-plural) demonstrative, \u2018this\u2019 or \u2018that\u2019. Thus combined, we understand precisely which single item of the kind is at issue. But now if we agree for the sake of argument that what an expression like \u2018this water\u2019 picks out is indeed a certain determinate, self-identical amount of water, then it seems plain that the identity of that water must be a function of the identity of the amount; and the identity of the amount is not specified by the combination of \u2018water\u2019 with \u2018this\u2019. Much as with \u2018dog\u2019, \u2018water\u2019 provides the kind-identity for the substance; but the identity of the amount depends on the answer to the question of how much water it is, and it is not the task of either the concept-word itself or the determiner to provide that information. The concept delivers the kind, but sets no bounds or limits on its application; and the determiner merely enables us to point out some stuff of the kind. Furthermore precisely what is identified or pointed out is determined \u2013 to the extent that anything is determined \u2013 by the language-independent context, and in particular, by the presumed presence of some isolated and determinate amount of stuff. The amount itself remains unspecified by the referential phrase, the use of which is itself compatible with the presence of any amount whatsoever.\nIn short \u2013 and precisely parallel with the idea of a number of objects of a certain kind \u2013 the idea of an amount of stuff of a certain kind introduces an additional factor, beyond that of a certain kind of stuff itself. The identity of some stuff of a specific kind depends not only upon the nature of that kind, but also on the amount of matter it embodies \u2013 a feature which it may or may not have in common with stuff of the same kind elsewhere, and which is no part of the concept in itself. Arguably, then, a sentence apparently involving reference to matter definitely or indefinitely designates some particular, determinate and self-identical amount of stuff of the relevant kind, whereby the amount itself is wholly adventitious, from the standpoint of the kind of stuff itself. Hence \u2018water\u2019 as such does not determine what is to count as the same water, and words like \u2018water\u2019 have no built-in principle of individuation \u2013 no principle of identity, whether numerical or quantitative, for what may be called the referential embodiments of the concept. The concept as such, as I urge in detail in the sequel, is merely that of boundless or \u2018undifferentiated\u2019 stuff.\nInsofar as we may speak of \u2018identity-conditions\u2019 for what we are referring to, in a situation of this kind, the information-content of \u2018this water\u2019 falls short of the identity-conditions of this water. In this sense, Jespersen is right: although water, air and clay are plainly taxonomic, kind-specifying terms for stuff or matter, they do not, all by themselves, introduce \u2018the idea of some definite thing with precise limits\u2019. There are good reasons for this disconnect between the content of mass concepts and their referential application: there is quite simply more to the concept of an amount of water, than to the concept of water in itself. Reference to some water introduces a concept which goes beyond the concept embodied in the noun itself \u2013 a concept which functions in a pragmatic mode, precisely because its content is not encoded in the semantics of that noun or concept-expression. Reference, in short, adds complexity; for not all talk of stuff is referential, even in the minimal sense of involving the use of bound variables. Mass nouns can occur in sentences, true or false, without determiners, boundless and \u2018bare\u2019; and here, the corresponding concepts can have application, even in the absence of Fregean arguments.\n This is a draft of part of a longer work. Questions and comments are welcome, but please do not quote without permission. The work originates in an attempt to supplement the argument of Words without objects, prompted by Tom McKay\u2019s critical notice of that book. Other than McKay, I must express my gratitude to several individuals for their support, helpful advice, comments, and encouragement. In particular, I must mention Johanna Seibt, Sebastian Rodl, Pierdanielli Giaretta, Mark Steen, Paul Needham, Lorne Maclachlan, Massimiliano Carrara, Josh Mozersky, David Bakhurst, Tim Elder and Philipp Blum. I have also learned much from the insights and comments of Kathrin Koslicki, the questions of Jennifer Hornsby, and the writings of Peter Simons.\n In other words, these categories are either essentially pre-scientific, or at least originally pre-scientific.\n The understanding of mass nouns and their significance has come to occupy a steadily growing space in regions overlapping logic, ontology, computing, linguistics, cognitive science, and the philosophy of language.\n We are prone to talk and think of objects; we talk so inveterately of objects that it is hard to say how else there is to talk\u2019, etc. Quine \u2013 albeit buried in scattered fragments, beneath the superficial edifice of what he himself describes as a \u2018reductive artifice\u2019.\n The elementary failure to distinguish between the truth-conditional semantics of \u2018some\u2019 and \u2018a\u2019, used as indefinite articles, is one such failure; the inability (as I\u2019ll urge) to represent the truth-conditions of sentences involving bare uses of count nouns is another. There are also common failures, or serious distortions, with regards to the natural-language readings of the symbolism of the calculus, and commonplace incorrect accounts of what, in non-technical terms, quantification itself amounts to. Some of these issues result from the fact that the semantics of the calculus (unsurprisingly) are exclusively truth-conditional. The issues are considered in the sequel.\nAs Edward Feser notes, \u2018many modern philosophers have uncritically swallowed the idea that physical science tells us everything we need to know about matter and that mind alone is problematic, so that a \u201cphilosophy of mind\u201d is needed in a way that a \u201cphilosophy of matter\u201d is not\u2019.\n There is, of course, the further question, of what defines \u2018the logical\u2019. Do formal systems lay down the law for natural languages; or is the boot on the other foot? Here, I side with Peter Strawson over Quine.\n \u2018Hegel\u2019s History of Philosophy\u2019, in Philosophy and its Past, by Jonathan Ree, Michael Ayers and Adam Westoby; Harvester Press, 1978.\n See, for example, the \u2018Introduction\u2019 to his Four Dimensionalism by Theodore Sider. Here, it seems, Sider makes the boldly a priori assumption that we cannot talk or think at all without the use of quantifiers, and if we are to say anything about stuff, he opines that \u2018Somehow, \u201cquantifiers\u201d over stuff must be introduced without slipping into talk of things\u2019 (6). But the force of this \u2018must\u2019 is unclear, as the argument to follow makes plain; and to say that the \u2018conceptual scheme of ordinary thought\u2019 seems to \u2018model the world as a world of things\u2019 (as Sider does) seems orthogonal to the commonplace and intuitive dichotomy of \u2018stuff and things\u2019.\n It is Davidson who speaks of \u2018the problem of mass nouns\u2019, following Quine\u2019s unconvincing attempt to answer Jespersen in Word and Object. See Davidson, \u2018Truth and meaning\u2019, p.\n The connections themselves, however, are typically constituted by (unspoken) thoughts.\n In this sense of the term, there can be no such things as ontologies, and so no such thing as an Aristotelian, Bergsonsian or Davidsonian ontology \u2013 unless these be nothing more than the attempts by particular individuals to make that single system of objective categories of being explicit.\n Notice that the point is consistent with its turning out that, for example, \u2018The object is red\u2019 means \u2018The object looks red under the normal conditions which obtain within the life-world\u2019.\n It would perhaps be more accurate to say that ontology in this sense incorporates \u2018folk ontology\u2019, since it might well go beyond it. But it seems to me extremely doubtful that ontology as refined by science could turn out to be incompatible with everyday ontology, the categories of which are not empirical but formal, logical or quasi-logical categories.\n Metaphysics as a whole, at least for some, is itself the theory, description, or \u2018account\u2019, of the entire web of belief. That, it seems to me, is the view of Peter Strawson in particular.\n Word and Object, pp. 2-4.\n In his \u2018The very idea of a conceptual scheme\u2019, Davidson is apt to construe such accounts as ontic, descriptions of reality per se (albeit relativised, in Quine\u2019s case at least, to some \u2018system of calibration\u2019). This, for reasons I consider in the sequel, is understandable, although the accounts are not best understood as mere descriptions of reality at all; but concern the impact on us of that limited portion of reality which is germane for us. But again, in Quine\u2019s case, the entire philosophy is underpinned by the deep anti-realism of the US philosophical tradition.\n On the other hand, whether or not Quine and Strawson would recognize any such \u2018straightforwardly objective sense\u2019 is very much a moot question.\n The mot juste is \u2018conception\u2019, since it is, as Descartes forcefully urges, impossible to imagine how things really are; imagination merely recapitulates perception, while things themselves are best described in the non-perspectival language of coordinate geometry, physics, and the rest of science, along with the matching ontic categories.\n Individual perspectives may be transcended through maps \u2013 geographical, stellar, galactic or cosmic \u2013 or better yet, through algebraic coordinate geometries; but the issue of \u2018primary and secondary qualities\u2019 is probably the locus classicus of the question of transcendence.\n Life is by and large worth living, and a disembodied life, if intelligible, would be no fun.\n It is the heart that defines what constitutes the home, and not the home, somehow otherwise defined, that determines where the heart is.\n The work of Daniel Casasanto and colleagues on aspects of the psychological dimensions of embodiment are gripping. See, for example, Casasanto, D. (2011). \u2018Different Bodies, Different Minds: The body-specificity of language and thought\u2019. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 20(6), 378\u2013383.\n Categories 2a33-34, 2b4-6. Closely related to this idea of fundamentality is the idea of an ontic hierarchy \u2013 an idea which is influential to this day. Thus for Quine, the \u2018tentative ontology for science\u2019 is described as the hierarchy of \u2018physical objects, classes of them, classes in turn of the elements of this combined domain, and so on up\u2019. W. V. O. Quine, The Ways of Paradox, 1966, 231. And for Strawson, the hierarchy is \u2018the series that starts with particular, and goes on with property or kind of particular, property or kind of property or kind of particular, etc.\u2019\u2018Singular Terms and Predication\u2019, Journal of Philosophy, 1961, 407.\n In the later Metaphysics, as everyone knows, matter does make its appearance \u2013 but again, in the view of many commentators, it appears as no more than a \u2018constituent\u2019, along with form, of the \u2018compound\u2019 concrete individual substance, and so, perhaps, considered in itself is merely an abstraction; but its ontic status seems never very clearly resolved.\n The Philosophy of Grammar, p.198.\n Thus Hegel: \u2018it matters not to a block of marble, whether it receive the form of this or that statue or even the form of a pillar. Be it noted however that a block of marble can disregard form only relatively, that is, in reference to the sculptor: it is by no means purely formless... it is an abstraction of the understanding which isolates matter into a certain natural formlessness. For properly speaking the thought of matter includes the principle of form throughout, and no formless matter therefore appears, anywhere even in experience as existing\u2019 (Logic).\n Such facts as these may be conducive to the thought that materials are dependent modes of being or abstractions, and even that reference is our linguistically basic and most natural mode of contact with the world.\n In general, arguably, phenomena of flow and circulation within an ecosystem pertain not primarily to individual physical objects, but distinctively to kinds of matter (water on our planet, liquid methane, for example, elsewhere in space and time).\n As mentioned in the Introduction, Quine approaches the issue with a strange seriousness, seeming to see it as a kind of threat to our \u2018adult\u2019, established talk of objects.\n Indeed as a proposal for transforming a prima facie incoherent thesis into a coherent thesis, the proposal represents an extension of the principle of charity in interpretation. On the other hand, Quine\u2019s remark that it is we who \u2018persist in breaking reality down somehow into a multiplicity of identifiable and discriminable objects, to be referred to by singular and general terms\u2019, itself embodies his profoundly anti-realist assimilation of ontology to a subject-centred life-world. Ultimately, what we see in Quine is a striking manifestation of the power of the life-world to dominate and warp our grasp of ontic categories.\n For reflective thought, the most characteristics consequence appears to be this, that bodies are conceived with Aristotle as possessing independent existence, and thereby primary, while matter is conceived as dependent, and thereby secondary, and perhaps even as a kind of abstraction.\n He writes, for example, that we think of particular things and events as included in the topics of our common discourse, as things about which we can talk to each other. These are remarks about the way we think of the world, about our conceptual scheme. A more recognizably philosophical, though no clearer, way of expressing them would be to say that our ontology comprises objective particulars.\n And \u2018flesh\u2019, it seems, will never take it.\n This is exactly what a Fregean function / argument model would require.\n \u2018Heraclitus and the Bath Water\u2019, 479-480.\n These are objects that exemplify Quine\u2019s principle of \u2018cumulative reference\u2019.\n Some nouns are plausibly classified as neither as count nor as non-count, such as \u2018scissors\u2019, \u2018pyjamas\u2019 and \u2018trousers\u2019 \u2013 nouns that require numeral classifiers to be involved in counting.\n There are numerous contexts in which occurrences of plural nouns can be read as \u2018at least one\u2019 instead of \u2018many\u2019 \u2013 these I call neutral readings of the plural \u2013 but such readings cannot apply either within referential contexts or in the context of plural or collective predication. There, the plural must be understood non-neutrally, as \u2018many\u2019, or \u2018at least two\u2019. The matter is considered further in the sequel; and see Table III.\n Selected Writings of Otto Jespersen, p. 272, Routledge Revivals (2010).\n The Philosophy of Grammar, p.198, my emphasis. As it happens, of course, an ideal language \u2018constructed on purely logical principles\u2019 had been conceived some fifty years earlier, although Jespersen himself seems to have been unaware of this. Created with a view to the analysis of statements about the realm of numbers, the basic breakthrough in Frege\u2019s Begriffsschrift famously consists in replacing the Aristotelian subject / predicate treatment of sentences with a formalism based on the mathematical duality of function and argument.\n \u2018Critical Notice of Words without Objects\u2019, Canadian Journal of Philosophy, July 2008.\n That stuffs are absolutely \u2018uncountable\u2019, as I have urged, is also, according to Robert Koons, a view shared by E. J. Lowe and Michael Dummett. See his review of Tuomas E. Tahko (ed.), Contemporary Aristotelian Metaphysics, Cambridge University Press, 2012, 263pp.\n Ironically, a fairly standard move involves reducing both the plural and non-count forms of non-singularity to special kinds of singularity \u2013 in the plural case, to sets or atomic mereological sums, and in the non-count case, to atomless mereological sums. However, such moves are incapable of explaining the (non-singular) behaviour of mass or non-count quantifiers.\n Corresponding to the threefold semantic contrast of singular, plural and non-count, there are two pairs of semantic contrasts among determiners which are syntactically marked in English. There is the referential contrast of plural and non-plural in the form of \u2018these\u2019 and \u2018this\u2019; on the other hand there is the quantifier-contrast of singular and non-singular \u2013 \u2018each\u2019, \u2018every\u2019 and \u2018a\u2019, versus \u2018all\u2019, \u2018some\u2019 and \u2018most\u2019 (\u2018the\u2019 and \u2018any\u2019 are all-purpose determiners).\n We need, following Helen Cartwright, to distinguish between what this water might have in common with that water \u2013 what may be called the \u2018universal amount\u2019, or just amount of water, and this water itself \u2013 what I propose to call a \u2018measure\u2019 of water, about which more will be said in due course.\n Thus, to anticipate, what it is, that is being said to slowly evaporate, is not some determinate amount of (liquid) water \u2013 since any such amount cannot survive the loss of any (liquid) water \u2013 is water simpliciter \u2013 that is, stuff of the kind, merely, and not some stuff of the kind. The point applies to any stuff involved in a cognate process of change \u2013 the wax of a burning candle steadily diminishes, but the wax that it is at any particular moment \u2013 this wax, say \u2013 cannot diminish, but can only cease to be. Closely analogous points could be made about rigid and non-rigid forms of plural reference.\n It is by no means self-evident that such determinacy is guaranteed by the concept; this is a respect in which uncountable concepts differ from countable or numerical concepts. It is of course possible to assign a measure (a liter, a kilo, etc) to an amount of water, but the mere assignment of the measure goes no way towards guaranteeing an objectively determinate amount.\n The same water must be the same amount of water, where that amount is an additional information factor, not contained within or given by either the concept-word or the entire referential expression itself. And there is a further worrisome issue here \u2013 a worry concerning the sense in which, given the intrinsic limitations on exactness, when it comes to measuring as against counting, an expression such as \u2018this water\u2019 does enable us to identify a specific amount of water, in the sense of \u2018identify\u2019 in which the word is associated with identity and re-identifiability, strictly understood.", "version": "v0"}

They can are also available in useful in virtually any destination in which a senior could have trouble getting up and down, like the chairs in the dining table or beside the sleep.\nEnhancing the level of burning in the house is a tiny, but essential upgrade you are able to for protection. Put extra lighting effects along stairwells, across the flooring, and next to entrances. If there\u2019s any area that does not have great lighting now, increase what\u2019s indeed there. As vision begins to get weaker, having that additional help to understand items around you much better becomes vital for lowering risks.\nIn every area where floor may get slippery, include nonslip mats or pay nonslip tape being add rubbing so falls are less likely to want to take place. This is certainly a fairly low priced and easy choice that can be truly helpful.\nShowers are one of the primary dangers in terms of senior falls. a bath chair makes it easier to obtain clean without fretting about falling while you are inside bath also makes it easier to get in-and-out regarding the bath safely.\nA transfer workbench is another option for getting in and out of the shower easier. In addition they double as shower seats, but they are created to be able to miss being forced to step throughout the edge of the bathtub and that can instead scoot to the other part. They prevent among trickiest moves seniors on a regular basis need certainly to make that advances the risk of a fall.\nCommodes are another huge danger aspect once getting out of bed and down becomes rather difficult. A raised lavatory chair is simpler to sit on and rise from without trouble, and including pubs to it gives seniors one thing to put up onto as they achieve this.\nAlthough they are various different products, we\u2019re lumping them collectively because we recommend them for similar purpose: giving seniors an approach to switch on the lights without having to move around in the dark to take action. A less high-tech selection for the same outcome is to position lamps strategically throughout the house in any spots where a senior may settle that aren\u2019t at your fingertips of a light switch (especially by the sleep).\nNot having to stumble in the dark discover a light switch gets rid of another common autumn risk for seniors. The clapper lets all of them switch on the light with a simple clap. A light that is included with a remote control can let them do so from wherever they use the remote (nonetheless they need certainly to keep up with it because of it to assist). Additionally the Amazon Echo is set such that it will switch on the lights when asked to do so with voiced terms.\nAnother big risk activity for seniors is wanting to attain things high up in a closet. While in most of those circumstances, their best activity is always to ask a caregiver or family member to help, if no one\u2019s around, seniors are at risk of try-on their very own instead of wait. Having a grabbing tool around can really help. They generate it easy to achieve greater or further than an individual may do by themselves.\nAre you looking for your own way to success?

Zvyangintsev\u2019s movie mercilessly portrays the state as a dysfunctional entity that condemns the innocent and protects the rich and the corrupt. It depicts courtrooms as shams, political leaders as thugs and orthodox priests as hypocritical accomplices.\nThe absence of justice in society is mirrored by the absence of tenderness at home. Solidarity and mutual understanding are rare, and individuals appear to evolve, for the most part, in selfish isolation. Zvyangintsev reveals these rifts in short and bitter ways as when Kolya\u2019s wife, Lilya, reciprocates her husband\u2019s \u2018I love you\u2019 with a remote \u2018I know\u2019. In that way, Leviathan is therefore far less hopeful than Ken Loach\u2019s Jimmy\u2019s Hall, a movie which shares the same theme of defending one\u2019s rights against a corrupt elite: while the latter believes in the strength of a community uniting to uphold common ideals, the former despairs of a person\u2019s inability to connect with others and prevail over the injustices at hand.\nIn addition to its political dimension, the movie powerfully explores the religious and philosophical depths of a person\u2019s suffering. Leviathan only shows in passing the dramatic events which unfold, whether it be trials, fights or death. Instead, it concentrates its attention on the effects of those events, in particular on Kolya, and the spiritual questioning which ensues. In so doing, the movie portrays Kolya as a novel incarnation of Job, the biblical character persecuted by Satan in an agonising test of faith. In the Bible\u2019s Book of Job, the power of the Leviathan, the mythical sea monster, is used by God to humble Job and ultimately save him: Job is convinced of his weakness and comes to accept his inability to understand God\u2019s plan. In Zvyangintsev\u2019s latest movie however, the many Leviathans that crush Kolya leave him lost and despaired \u2013 they bear no promise of redemption.\nLeviathan succeeds in painting a world at once dark and sublime, where human presence appears precarious and transitory. The movie is framed at its beginning and end by immense and desolate landscapes \u2013 frozen fields, empty rivers and colossal waves beating on black rocks. Its colours are for the most part sombre and its music, composed by Philip Glass, majestically obsessive.\nIn one of the movie\u2019s most striking moments, Kolya\u2019s teenage son, Roma, discovers the immense skeleton of a whale, abandoned on a frozen beach; in a later scene, Lilya has a momentary glimpse of another whale, alive this time, emerging from the sea. Leviathan fascinates by the breadth of its scope and its singular apparitions: the corruption of a community and the suffering of an individual are displayed with the same menacing grace as the decaying carcass of a great whale or a fleeting shadow at sea.", "version": "v0"}

An important part of training is the willingness to learn. The willingness of employees to undergo training helps them gain maximum benefits from it, leading to growth and success for them and the company.\nThe greatest incentive for a person to perform a task is the fulfillment of a short-term gain. Therefore, employees must be informed about the benefits the training will provide them both in the short and the long term. Specifying the benefits gives them a realistic goal that is achievable, and helps them become eager to gain new knowledge and skills to achieve those goals.\nAn incentive does not necessarily need to be monetary. A day off, a special day, or an evening of fun games helps employees stay motivated and positive. Any group activity also helps encourage team spirit, which leads to better cooperation among employees.\nTaking the opinion of employees before selecting a training program for them helps build their self-esteem and improves trust. Even if the final decision is contrary to the wishes of the employees, they will be motivated to undergo the training if they are convinced of the benefits of the training program for them and the company. Considering their opinion is, therefore, an important step in enhancing their self-worth and keeping them motivated about training.\nIf employees are not aware of the precise and possible outcomes of a training program, they will be less motivated to make the effort to learn. A manager\u2019s role is crucial. The manager must inform employees about all possible outcomes of the training before the training begins so that they have a realistic goal that they know will improve their professional worth.\nThe training outcomes will assist with the betterment of both their professional and personal life, as both are closely connected. It will provide employees an incentive to receive continuous training, and enough motivation to engage in self-learning to accelerate growth.\nAs professionals need to undergo frequent training, they must receive professional coaching and mentoring to help them stay motivated and achieve more from training. As all our efforts must result in a gain, it is essential to provide employees with a real and clear aim that the training will achieve for them. Motivating employees to train effectively can be accomplished by informing them of the lifelong worth that the training will achieve for them.\n", "version": "v0"}

A Professional Engineer's Analysis.\nTribometer (sometimes called a slipometer) coefficient of friction measurements can be easily manipulated. Professional Engineers can determine the actual cause(s) of a slip, trip, and fall accident. A Professional Engineer can also determine which Codes and Standards are violated, whether the hazard was created by the owner, whether a pedestrian injury is foreseeable, etc. The Professional Engineer can serve as an expert witness if necessary.\nPeople slip, trip, and fall on walkways, sidewalks, paths, parking lots, steps, and stairways for many reasons. Among the more common reasons are clumsiness, a slippery surface, not paying attention, and defects in the surface or steps where the person fell. Many people walk in places where there are defects, but not all slip, trip, and fall injuries occur because of negligence.\nThis is not a criticism of the concept of coefficient of friction measurements or a comment on their value when properly used. This discussion applies to the widespread misuse of coefficient of friction measurements in evaluating slip and fall incidents. This is not applicable to properly made slip resistance measurements used, for example, by flooring manufacturers.\nCoefficient of friction is the ratio of the force of friction between two bodies and the force pressing them together. Static friction is the friction force when an object is not moving. Static friction is the force that prevents a block from sliding down an incline. Kinetic friction (also called dynamic friction) is the force when two objects are moving relative to each other. Generally, the kinetic coefficient of friction is less than the static coefficient of friction.\nCoefficient of friction and slip resistance are often used interchangeable. Although they are related concepts, they are not identical. Slip resistance is what one is looking at in slip and fall incidents.\nA slippery surface can cause a fall. Years ago, a block of a known weight was dragged across the surface to measure the static slip resistance. However, slip, trip, and fall incidents occur when people are walking, so the dynamic slip resistance appears to be more appropriate.\nA Tribometer is a device for measuring tribological quantities. Tribology is the science of the interaction between surfaces in motion relative to each other. Tribology includes the application of the principles of friction, lubrication, fluids and fluid flow, materials properties. In slip and fall incidents, human dynamics and human reaction to a perceived loss of friction play a roll. Tribology includes mechanical engineering, materials science and engineering, fluid flow, physics, and chemistry. When analyzing slip and fall incidents using tribology, human factors must also be included.\nVarious methods of measuring dynamic slip resistance. have been devised and some have been accept by Courts. In many cases, these measurements are made by self-proclaimed safety experts with no Engineering background. The device used to make these measurements is often referred to as a Tribometer (sometimes called a slipometer), although there are other trade names by which a Tribometer is called. In some cases, Courts and Insurance companies have accepted these measurements blindly, and used them to decide negligence or pay a settlement.\nThere is no objective standard for measuring coefficient of friction on existing steps, paths, walkways, floors, driveways, etc. Standards exist for the measuring the coefficient of friction of manufactured flooring, and these standards have been misapplied to existing construction.\nMany people do not know exactly where they fell, or where their foot was located at the moment before they fell. The measured coefficient of friction can be different at different points on a surface.\nThe measuring devices often do not accurately reproduce the conditions when the person fell. The operator of the measurement device often cannot accurately reproduce the motion of the person's foot before the slip, trip, and fall incident.\nThe coefficient of friction measurement can be influenced by the person taking the measurement. Based on irregularities in the surface, one can set up the Tribometer to show a higher or lower coefficient of friction measurement.\nThe yellow arrow shows a coefficient of friction measurement taken on an upward-sloped surface. This measurement will be fairly because the Tribometer will hit against the upward-sloped surface.\nThe orange arrow shows a coefficient of friction measurement taken on a downward-sloped surface. This measurement will be low because the Tribometer will slide on the downward-sloped surface.\nThe green arrow shows a coefficient of friction measurement taken on a flat surface. This measurement will be between the upward-sloped surface and the downward-sloped surface.\nThe actual coefficient of friction depends on the person's footwear. Often, the measurement is taken with a generic material.\nBecause of irregularities in the surface, the size of the contact area is critical. Someone's shoe may be contacting different sections of a surface with different slip resistance measurements.\nMany people slip on wet surfaces, so it has become a common practice to pour water on a surface and measure the coefficient of friction. The quantity of water and impurities in the water can influence slip resistance. Spilling a cup of water on a surface does not accurately reproduce the conditions that existed when a person fell. All that is often determined is that a wet surface is more slippery than a dry surface.\nThe Tribometer does not accurately measure the coefficient of friction on a wet surface even if the exact liquid and floor conditions can be reproduced. This is because the dynamics of the Tribometer on a liquid surface are considerably different than the dynamics of a person's footwear.\nCoefficient of friction measurements do not take into account hydroplaning-type phenomenon. (Hydroplaning and aquaplaning are generally reserved for the behavior of rolling objects like tires). Hydroplaning occurs when a film of water builds up between a tire and the road, causing the tire to loose contact with the road. A similar phenomenon occurs when there is a layer of water between shoes and a floor.\nCoefficient of friction measurement ignores the fact that when a human being walks, it is a feedback process. The human gait is a closed-loop feedback system, where the brain makes adjustments based on expected conditions and conditions found. Measuring the dynamic slip resistance ignores the feedback part of a human's walk.\nIn some cases, measurement of coefficient of friction (often by non-Engineer self-proclaimed safety experts) has replaced an evaluation of the defects and cause of the slip, trip, and fall accident by a Professional Engineer. Just measuring the coefficient of friction without determining why the person slipped and fell is bad engineering.\nThe Harold Krongelb P.E. does not use questionable coefficient of friction measurements in evaluating the cause of a slip, trip, and fall injury. Rather, actual defects in the design or maintenance are reported. In many cases, these defects are code violations that provide objective evidence as to the cause of the slip, trip, and fall injury.", "version": "v0"}

Just about the most important steps in organizing a bathroom remodeling project would be that the bathroom has the correct amenities and fixtures that have the capacity to provide value and function. Through selecting the best designs and meticulous planning, it might be easy to obtain the bathroom of your dreams. Listed below are essential ideas to transform any project in a reality.\nBefore contacting remodeling companies for your personal bathroom remodeling project, you first need to gauge the requirements of everyone which uses this space. Look at the finishes and fixtures which will benefit your entire members of the family. Is now even the time to work through a financial budget on what you are prepared to dedicate to the project. This initial planning can help in sticking to your budget.\nShould you be possessing a difficult experience setting your personal plan into motion, you are able to gain important insights from remodeling contractors. These professionals can often offer you by using a vision in the style you wish to achieve and they are efficient in working with the scheduling of vendors and installers.\nMost homes typically feature one bathroom or maybe more using a bathtub, toilet and sink. Optional extras usually feature a shower or even a bidet. Additional sinks are probably the more popular choices in bathroom remodeling projects in which the bathroom is often employed by a couple of people.\nShould you be looking for ways to save on the demolition and renovations, it really is highly suggested to hold the new plumbing fixture near to the existing plumbing. However, when the remodeling company finds how the plumbing or wiring is outdated, they are going to usually recommend gutting out your old wires and pipes, allowing space for installing newer ones along with changing the present location.\nShould your finances are limited and you choose to keep with your overall footprint, there are still techniques that can be used to produce the lavatory appear bigger. By way of example, pedestal sinks can certainly make the space appear more spacious, while glass shower-doors can be a better choice over a shower curtain which often blocks the sunlight and makes the space appear enclosed. Another good way to make the bathroom look bigger is to get a bigger mirror which automatically doubles the visual appearance from the spaces that surround your vanity areas.\nEven though elegant and luxurious finished on your faucets will make your bathroom appear more elegant, the proper lights are necessary to the complete appeal of the project. Some thoughts for bathroom lighting include wall sconces over or beside your mirror or a mixture of LED recessed lights.\nOverhead lighting within your bathroom is a vital element. While ambient options to consider included frosted-glass fixtures or sunken-track lighting. Perimeter lighting can also be used to create an ambient and soft glow. Other ideas include the use of pendant lighting which scatters light in most directions that gives the illusion of your attractive centerpiece ceiling.\nWood floors are not viewed as the most common choice in the event it visit bathrooms from a practical perspective, however they can infuse your bathrooms with character. When sealed properly, the stained wood floors are normally durable enough to withstand general bathroom use.\nIf you are searching for ways to make your small bathroom appear larger, ensure that the color palette you may have chosen remains throughout the white-to-cream color spectrum.\nIf you are looking to attain a vintage seek out your bath room think of built-ins like recessed medicine cabinets, soap dishes or even your toilet-roll holders.\nIt is usually advisable to stick to cream or white colored fixtures especially when it comes to your bathtub or toilets. The explanation for this is that in many cases the colored fixtures often have a tendency to appear dated or not any longer fashionable inside a few short years. While it may be true that you could swap from the toilet with minimal effort, replacing your bathtub calls for a substantial demolition along with the costs associated with swapping from the bathtub or shower.\nIn the event the space inside your bathroom provides for additional pieces, many of the professional decorators suggest having a single freestanding piece for instance a cupboard or chair as the design element. When it comes to compensating for this space, you might like to recess a number of the other practical elements just like a clothes hamper or moving the hamper into another room. Your decorative pieces should likewise serve practical uses such as a region where you can store soaps, towels or other small bathroom items.\nOne of several easiest devices you can use to create the desired mood in the bathroom is always to purchase a practical dimmer switch. Dimmer switches are ideal for those late-night baths.\nOne of many famous Feng Shui tips involves never owning your toilet positioned in how it faces the door. Most experts suggest that toilets need to be positioned 90 degrees to some door or at least several feet out of your door.\nOne of several most effective to incorporate \u201csurface areas\u201d into the bathroom without physically adding in counter-top surface areas is to incorporate hooks. High-quality hooks are useful with regards to hanging all sorts of items such as towels, your best bathrobe or perhaps your clothes.\nMost people are of the opinion that a mirror in a bathroom only serves the intention of looking in the mirror to conduct tasks for example shaving or doing one\u2019s makeup. Yet mirrors in a overall bathroom design adds elements into the room by having light to the room or making a small space appear bigger. If you are looking to include light and space into the bathroom you might like to consider the installation of an additional mirror in the wall that is opposite in your vanity.\nBead-board serves two important functions. To begin with it can assist you to achieve an antique appeal within your bathroom and this item is very easy-to-install. Another reason for bead-board is the fact offers the valuable purpose of protecting lower parts of your walls from water splashes that occur from the shower or tub. Be sure to cover the bead-board by using a high-quality oil-based paint that will ensure that it must be immune to moisture.\nHow Long Does An Average Bathroom Remodel Take?\nFor the full-scale tear out accompanied by a rebuild for smaller bathrooms usually do not take long. When all the working parts are combined together, you can typically expect around 23 days. This estimate is founded on that no work will probably be done over weekends, which results in 4.5 weeks.\nHowever, this estimate might not be accurate since you need to consider that your tradesman arrives by the due date daily and this each of the materials are available and that you stick to your plans without making any changes that could slow up the process. Because reality often fails to cooperate with your plans, it can be safe to rather double the amount estimated period of time to around 46 days in order to avoid disappointment.\nLots of house owners want a general idea of just how much it costs to remodel a bathroom.

All visitors pass through several secure areas before entering the facility, access is also closely monitored and logged using door-entry systems and 24-hour electronic surveillance.\nThe key aspect in the design of our hosting centre has been the ease with which faults can be identified, diagnosed and resolved. Each installed server and firewall system employs a policy based event logging, notification and resolution system, which is configured to automatically restart failed services in accordance with a determined policy.\nIntrusion Detection Systems (IDS) constantly monitor the network for any signature attacks such as denial of service and will notify the hosting centre manager should any occur. This then links into the centralised monitoring system, which constantly monitors for messages and sends alerts, based on our tightly defined criteria.\nOur hosting centre uses extensive Firewall solutions to help protect servers against malicious hacking and viruses. We also provide solutions that enable dynamic detection of suspicious network activity and instantly prevent unauthorised access to data and system resources.\nEach cabinet is individually powered with an individual fire detector, which will shut off the power to the cabinet prior to a fire developing.\nThe facility is totally self-sufficient with regard to mains power as it is equipped with a building UPS and standby power generator.\nNetwork Services from four separate carriers are diversely routed into the building to provide additional resilience.\nDaily backups for each server are carried out using a 4-week rotational schedule with copies stored off site for maximum protection. SQL databases have additional transactional backups as a custom service for each installation.", "version": "v0"}

Bell ringers standing in the cold outside malls and stores, collecting change for charity in red kettle.\nBut for many in the community, that red kettle is all they know about The Salvation Army, the international organization that has made the red metal bucket a signature part of holiday donations. The same rang true for many of the fellows participating in Ford\u2019s first Thirty Under 30 program.\nThe nine-month leadership program instructs 30, millennial-aged Ford employees on what it takes to work in philanthropy. In addition to learning how charities work, the Thirty Under 30 fellows provide insights for non-profits to better connect with the largest generation of young people since the Baby Boomers came of age.\nLast year, 10 fellows each collaborated with the Salvation Army, Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries and the United Way for Southeastern Michigan. While helping these nonprofits create solutions applicable to longstanding programs and new initiatives, the millennial employees were taken through a learning process called design thinking by experts at the Henry Ford Learning Institute. The process involves using solution-based design methodologies and applying them to life, business, cultural situations \u2014 or in this case, the three Detroit-area nonprofits.\nFor many of the fellows, the most important building block that design thinking helped to provide when approaching the nonprofit focus points was empathy.\n\u201cEmpathy is the biggest piece to the puzzle,\u201d said Roy Yewah, a member of the inaugural Thirty Under 30 class and a Financial Analyst in Ford\u2019s Manufacturing, Parts and Logistics area.\nUnifying the voices so all are heard on an equal plane is a key to reaching the fulfilling circle of volunteerism and satisfying service needs. In other words \u2013 learning what is behind all those red kettles.\nJames Peng, a Thirty Under 30 participant, control systems engineer in Dearborn, said one of the projects for the Salvation Army was finding ways to attract a younger audience through Echelon, the nonprofit\u2019s National Young Adult Auxiliary.\nFor the Salvation Army Outdoors program, the Ford employees advocated spreading the word via the summer camps and the fall back-to-school backpacking event.\nThey also looked for solutions to improve efficacy for the nonprofit\u2019s Bed & Bread Club, which aims to make 3,000 to 4,500 sandwiches each day with two full-time employees and volunteers.\nThis project reinforced the idea that every little bit counts when it comes to volunteering or giving, program participant Meredith Citkowski, a chemical engineer with the Lincoln Continental program at the Flat Rock Assembly Plant, said.\nHer group developed an idea following tire tracks Henry Ford created. Utilizing an assembly line concept, the peanut butter and jelly sandwich, a childhood lunch fave, became a meal for thousands.\n\u201cWe prototyped our micro-volunteer opportunity concept and made one sandwich every 6.5 seconds,\u201d Citkowski said.\nThat resulted in 1,100 sandwiches by hand in about two hours before they ran out of bread.\n\u201cAdvanced planning, together with a high volume of volunteer participation, made for a highly efficient and highly impactful volunteer project,\u201d she said.\nOn optimum days, they averaged 3.09 seconds per sandwich. However, without volunteers the assembly slows to 9.60 seconds, or only 3,000 sandwiches made, causing 500 fewer people to get a meal.\nWhile many of the millennials wanted quick volunteering projects to go along with their kinetic lifestyles, they discovered the design-thinking process requires the patience to shelve preconceived notions of others and a willingness to revisit ideas that provide an ah-ha! moment deeper into the project.\nThe collaboration of 30 millennials and the three nonprofits already is paying off.\nWhile more than 200 employees applied for the inaugural Thirty Under 30 class, the number of applicants to the sophomore class, which kicked off in February, increased 72 percent to 362. The new group has one focus \u2014 food insecurity.\nAnd the number of participating nonprofits also has increased, doubling to six, including Gleaners Community Food Bank, Crossroads of Michigan, Yad Ezra, Fish & Loaves Community Food Pantry, Pope Francis Center and Ford Mobile Food Pantry.\nAs a new advocate of the design-thinking approach, Peng anticipates volunteering to help with the second Thirty Under 30 class. He added that he can incorporate the tools he learned in other philanthropic ventures and on his 9-to-5 job.\nLikewise, Yewah and his group plan to continue working with nonprofits. They are developing a foundation to help local nonprofits locate experienced personnel who can address ongoing issues concerning leadership, funding and volunteerism.\n\u201cAllowing them to consult (with) nonprofits for the better will be extremely satisfying and attractive in order for our continued success as a foundation,\u201d he said. They now await word from the Bill Ford Better World Challenge committee, a global grant program awarding as much as $500,000 to winning civic projects, to learn if their creation is a winner.", "version": "v0"}

Before going to Viva Las Vegas this year, I wanted to add a little bling to my 1955 Studebaker Champion with a metal flake paint job.\nStudie and I have been through a lot together in the five years I\u2019ve owned and drove her. I\u2019ve become attuned to her original patina\u2019d coral and white paint job. So originally the thought of changing her exterior in any way made me nervous. But the more I thought about adding a subtle sparkle to Studie\u2019s white roof portion, the more I liked the idea.\nNot knowing the first thing about how to paint, I was lucky to have an expert nearby. Pati Fairchild is the newest member of my car club, the Gasoline Girls. She also happens to be a professional paint and body chick who teaches the subject at El Camino College.\nAfter polling friends on Facebook and looking through various paint samples, I paid a visit to Coast Airbrush in Anaheim for my final selection. I went in knowing I wanted an abalone sort of flake that would disappear in the shade but be super sparkly in the sun. The friendly guy at Coast Airbrush highly recommended the House of Kolor Ice Pearl Flake.\nI\u2019d had a little experience with Ice Pearl before. Co-Gasoline Girl Lori\u2019s F1 is covered in ice pearl over bare metal \u2013 and it\u2019s a crowd stopper at every car show we attend (as you can tell in the picture above!) After being blinded by the sparkling white ice pearl in the sunshine, it didn\u2019t take me long to decide it was the way to go.\nWe ended up doing three coats of White and Red House of Kolor Ice Pearl flake mixed into clear, covering that in two coats of plain clear \u2013 for a total of five coats. Pati showed me how to spray as she did the first coat and then I grabbed the gravity feed gun for the last four.\nGun in hand for the first time, I was a little nervous about how to paint. Keeping in mind that Pati told me to spray even and steady, I quickly found a rhythm. The ladies said I looked like a pro. I\u2019ve gotta say I\u2019m looking forward to my next chance to paint!\nThe Ice Pearl Paint sure does sparkle when the sun hits it right! Although ultimately I might want a heavier metal flake, I think the ice pearl flake was a great decision. It kept my patina\u2019d roof looking just like it always has\u2026but when the sun hits it, watch out!\nI\u2019ve still got a ways to go before giving Stude the real body attention she needs. But until then, she\u2019s got a little sparkle inside and out\u2026just like me!\nMany thanks to Pati Fairchild, El Camino College, and the Gasoline Girls!\nIf you know of any young ladies interested in car careers, check out El Camino College\u2019s Women in Technology Program!\nNice job! Kind of reminds me of those motorcycle helmets from back in the day! Also, I never saw anything like your friends clear over bare metal before, cool!\nI wish i know some girls interested in old school rides like You.\nI love the 60s Metal Flake style.\nLove the look been painting for over 40 years getting ready to do a large gold metal flake job on my 62 year old brothers ford ranger with shell so it will be a lot of spraying. Did motor cycle flaking in the seventies definately much easier today.\nLovin the flake on bare metal idea\u2026.sounds sweet! Great to see us girls are starting to get a name for ourselves within this mainly male dominated industry\u2026\u2026I\u2019d be highly interested in goin to your college\u2026if you were in Australia!!!!!!

If you have a suggestion for a topic you\u2019d like covered in this column, drop Tim a line!\nBoth the Sith Inquisitor and Jedi Consular offer you the choice of a melee character or a ranged one. The melee classes are close up action where you are fighting alongside your companion or other players in a group, whereas the ranged characters fight from a distance.\nThe Sith Assassin is the Melee character, and the Sith Sorcerer is the ranged class. For the Republic side the Jedi Shadow is the Melee class and the Jedi Sage the ranged one. The classes on opposing sides are very similar in their abilities (albeit it with different names) so after a period of familiarisation either should feel comfortable to you.\nSo how do you make the decision on which way to go?\nFirstly from a faction viewpoint, you will likely have an opinion on which side you will want to start playing \u2013 I rushed to create a Sith Inquisitor for the \u201cdark side\u201d experience (although of course you can make \u201cdark side decisions\u201d as a republic player) and then moved to the Sith Sorcerer because I like the ranged attacks more than melee.\nAnother decision which can play a factor in melee vs ranged is server location. Aussie SWTOR players in general have until recently suffered a disadvantage compared to their overseas opponents, mostly due to our physical location. Most SWTOR servers reside in other countries and as the game has to send and receive information to and from the servers you can see that in theory the further away you are from the action the more you could suffer a disadvantage. Even though the time is measured in milliseconds these differences count.\nSWTOR does a good job generally of trying to even things up to a degree, but with PVP in particular things can get very hectic. Play SWTOR for any period of time and you will hear about lag. This becomes an issue because every single key-press or mouse-click has to be transmitted. And of course information on your surrounding areas (opposing players movements, NPCs, and anything else that moves or does something) has to be updated. The reality is if other players reside in the same country as the server, then it takes much less time for their key-press or mouse click to be sent and received as well as the other game state updates. We are still talking milliseconds here, but in a PVP situation milliseconds can count. Depending on the lag you might find the opposing player has time to issue several commands to your single one \u2013 And from their point of view, you seem to be very \u201cslow\u201d and easy to defeat as a result and he/she seems almost invulnerable because every time you go to attack he/she beats you to the punch.\nThe reason the melee vs ranged decision is a problem on overseas servers is how the classes operate. The up- close melee classes can suffer more with lag in my experience than ranged classes. One example is a \u201cfrom behind\u201d attack (Jedi Shadow and Sith Assassin). If you have lag issues it\u2019s going to be harder as a rule to position yourself quickly as it\u2019s more about co-ordinating movements and attacks at the right time versus just issuing attacks as a ranged class.\nSo yes we Aussies and New Zealanders have a good excuse of why we are not good at PVP. Well maybe not! While there is not doubt lag plays a part a good player can work within these limits. In any event, the good news is that all of this has changed with the recent introduction of local servers in Australia.\nOut of interest you can hover your mouse in game over the latency button to get a general idea of your speed. Also known as your ping. As you can see in the two pictures, I have shown you my ping on an American server and an Aussie server . As you can see with the exact same Internet connection the American server has about four or fives times high latency than the Aussie server. This can make a big difference.\nIn case you are wondering, I am with Bigpond Cable on their Ultimate package and loving the 33 ms latency. I moved there because it is the fastest possible Internet access in my area. Add local servers to the mix and I am in heaven!\nWith lag being taken out of the equation, other factors in deciding which advanced class apart from the melee or ranged questions are, whether you wish to focus on healing, whether you like the benefits of invisibility, if you want to be a tank in game, to name three common ones.\nMake sure you choose carefully though because once you choose between melee and ranged, it can never be changed for that character. That said, the thing to remember is that you only need to level up a character to around level 10 and leaving your first planet, to get access to the advanced classes. So there is nothing stopping you from leveling up a few characters and trying both sides before deciding where to put your focus in the long term.\nThanks for reading and I\u2019ll be back next week!\nRange FTW. Dominance in Huttball \u2013 gotta control that center \u2013 as you stand up top blasting everything in sight. Operations favour range greatly, fights become so much easier. We had a very heavy melee 8 man NiM group at the start, since rolled ranged alts and converted to 16 man and loving it.\nI agree totally with your point about latency. I much prefer being a sorcerer and not having to concentrate on my position as much.\nHats off to you Oceanic melee players, the local server is well deserved!\nThanks for that \u2013 Yes sorcerer for the win. I\u2019ve got a lvl 41 on a US server and have been levelling another on an Aussie server.

For our compatible products, we offer a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee allowing you to return products within 6 months if you are unsatisfied.\nFor the home office that requires business functionality, the HP OfficeJet 5610 is a very appealing all-in-one color inkjet printer. It puts printing, scanning, copying, and faxing features into a very compact design that is perfect for those who have limited space. Print speeds are 20 pages per minute for black and 13 pages per minute for color, and HP 5610 printer ink costs are not too high.\nThe 5610 also goes by the names of 5610v and 5610xi. The first is an international version, while the second adds memory card slots and PictBridge support that the basic models lack. While the compact design is one of the most appealing features, not everyone may like its gray and black aesthetics. More importantly, there are a few sacrifices made for such a small frame. For example, the input and output paper trays are both oriented toward the front, which can mean more bending and sometimes more frequent paper jams.\nThe inclusion of an automatic document feeder may be a significant upgrade for users of all-in-one devices with only a flatbed scanner, and it can be a real time-saver. The feeder is limited to 25 sheets, but this should be enough for the average copying, faxing, and scanning needs of a home user.\nThe HP 5610 ink cartridge system employs a single black and a combined tricolor supply. Users also have the option of a photo color OfficeJet 5610 ink cartridge that replaces the black and provides better photo quality. This is not a requirement, however, and many users may find swapping different types of OfficeJet 5610 printer ink is more trouble than it is worth.\nThe 5610 provides the business features that home users may need, and still manages to produce solid photo prints. Its purchase price is quite reasonable considering all of its functionality, and buyers won't have to spend a lot on HP 5610 ink over time, making it a good value.", "version": "v0"}

Officially, this earns me no special distinction. There's a medal honoring those who have participated in 20 Tours and a silver plate for those that have managed to endure 30 grandes boucles, as the Tour is often called. But for me, the quarter-century mark holds particular significance, if only as a reminder that I am getting old. It\u2019s my own silver anniversary.\nBicycle racing these days, with its complicated past, is ever insistent that we look to the future of the sport. Fair enough. But in terms of pure numbers, it is clear that I have covered more Tours in the past than I will cover in the future. I cannot help but take a look back.\nI covered my first Tour de France in 1990 and started reporting on the race full time when I moved to France in 1992. I essentially presided over cycling\u2019s Lost Generation: While the situation has improved, for years many cyclists careers were compromised by the ubiquitous presence of performance-enhancing drugs.\nBut while talk of drug use has never subsided, it has far from overshadowed my own experience at the Tour. No, what impressed me most when I first arrived at the race was the camaraderie and the overall mood of celebration. The Tour was its own sort of \u201cmoveable feast,\u201d to borrow a term from a famous American writer who once called France home.\nThe Tour was for me, the great French road trip, and each year there was another road movie to write. There were frequent picnic stops along the roadside, as organizers offered tastes of local dishes and local drinks to members of the Tour de France family. And just about every journalist actually drove along the Tour de France route.\nKilometer 92 was the meeting place for the daily feast. Everyone covering the race seemed to blast ahead once the race started, in order to have sufficient time to generously savor the local specialties before picking up the race again.\nToday, organized picnics are a rarity as the free flow of local wines means risks for increasingly security-minded race organizers. And there are just plain fewer people accredited to drive the Tour route. Some are discouraged for security reasons, while others choose to save time by driving directly to the finish. Personally I continue to drive the route, perhaps out of habit, but also because I simply prefer to see things that are not broadcast on television.\nIn my first interview with Jean-Marie Leblanc in 1993, the legendary race director lamented of the \u201cgigantisme\u201d of the Tour, the supersized nature of the race. Aware of the potential dividends generated by the increased media and marketing interests around the world, he was also preoccupied by the hazards of such growth. He was worried about the logistical complexities of this ever-growing machine. And he was worried about the race\u2019s ability to maintain its integrity with the people largely responsible for the making the Tour what it is today\u2014the fans.\nToday the Tour has lost some of its charm. The once magical Barnum of bicycle racing is now a well-oiled machine that travels around the country in lockstep perfection. There is less room for the inherent folly that made the race magical.\nBut I keep coming back because, well, I guess even if it is less intoxicating, there is still enough of the magic to go around.\nUndoubtedly the three common denominators to the Tour\u2019s success over the decades are the fans, the riders themselves, and the race\u2019s utterly unique pastoral background.\nYear in and year out fans continue to flood the roadside. Over the decades I have seen no discernable difference in their numbers. No matter who is winning or what scandal is brewing, the fans are faithful.\nAnd the riders, too, have remained essentially unchanged. Sure, today they\u2019re cloistered in team buses instead of sitting on the hoods of their team cars, and press officers limit their availability. But once I actually sit down with one of the cyclists, I continue to be impressed by his humility. Cycling, it seems, is just too brutal of a sport to allow for unbridled arrogance.\nAnd lastly the Tour de France remains a true Tour de la France. Wander as it will from its own borders, the race remains free from the confines of a stadium.\nSo I will begin this 25th Tour de France in search of many of the race\u2019s magical ingredients, great racing by top riders on a stage second to none. Sometimes these elements can appear obscured, but I know from experience, that if I look hard enough, they still can be found in abundance.\nStartt reflects on his favorite Tour images in our special iPad feature, \"James Startt's Tour de France.\" It's available by downloading our iPad app.\nA Shorter Tour de France?", "version": "v0"}

Any occasion worth the name is appropriate for flower gifts: birthdays, funerals, graduation, weddings, Graduation Day, Retirement Day, Valentine\u2019s Day etc. forming an integral part of our lives.

But today, with so many flower choices, there are no rules \u2013 it\u2019s the sentiment that gives the gift its meaning. Your florist can help you send the right message. Many people assign their own personal meanings \u2013 a flower or color that might remind them of a special event or moment in their lives.\nIn the Arab World they were traditionally used for funerals and weddings; they do not make good gifts from a man, although a woman could give them to her hostess. In Arab culture, gifts are given or received with the right hand, not with the left. Using both hands, however, is acceptable.\nFlowers generally do not feature as heavily in Islamic traditions when compared to other major religions. Roses are sometimes chosen for use in marriages or funerals, along with various palm leaves. Roses have been greatly used for their heavy perfume in Arabic and Muslim culture for a very long time. To this end, rose water is also sprinkled on new graves at the end of the ceremony. Whole white roses are sometimes used to symbolize virtue. Jasmine is sometimes also used in funerals. Islamic artwork in religious places are usually embellished with many types of flower images and winding floral patterns. Islamic gardens designed for meditation specifically include citrus trees for their pleasant-smelling orange blossoms.\nFlowers and leaves from the Henna plant are especially prized for the dark dye that is extracted and used to decorate the skin and hair. Intricate, floral or geometric henna patterns are drawn on the hands and feet of brides before the wedding as a symbol of fertility and good fortune.\nAs a flower shop in Dubai, iFlorabella has managed to not just carve a niche of its own, but win the hearts of thousands with their service.\nGifting a flower is the most beautiful thing you can do to impress your loved ones.\nCan Dubai Flower Deliver to whole world or only UAE did it found any information related delivery.\nIt really is a nice and practical item of information.

Eventually people noticed that it frequently rained after the fighting had ceased. In 1870 a civil engineer proposed that the wartime explosions themselves had provoked the rain, suggesting a key to rainmaking. To test the notion, Congress funded experiments in the 1890s; they failed, and their leader, R. G. Dryenforth, became known as Major Dryhenceforth. Hosler says that since battles were generally fought under rainfree skies, it only makes sense that a rainy day would follow many a sunny-day fight.\nIn the 1960s Esso Oil (now part of Exxon Mobil) proposed that coating the earth with black paving materials like asphalt would increase air temperature enough to spur formation of cumulus clouds and encourage rain. To test the idea, the company planned to spray a 20-square-mile patch of asphalt on Venezuela\u2019s Paraguan\u00e1 Peninsula. But the project was halted before it even began when a Venezuelan government official questioned the company\u2019s motives for the project. Asphalt, it turned out, was a by-product of Esso\u2019s Venezuelan oil refinery\u2014and the government watchdog suspected that the company wanted to use the asphalt within the country chiefly to avoid export taxes.\nOne of the strangest weather-related substances in recent times could be Dyn-o-Gel, a polymer powder purportedly able to absorb 1,500 to 2,000 times its weight in water by transmuting into a gel.

They'll lick you, the floor under your table and anything else emitting an enticing scent. But obsessive licking habits signal a problem. The possible concerns are many and varied, and the cause affects which solutions work. Your dog's licking is obsessive or compulsive if it has no sensible trigger like the presence of food, if it's highly repetitive or unnaturally sustained or if your dog can't be interrupted while she's at it.\nThe first course of action for treating your dog's obsessive licking is to go in for a veterinary checkup to rule out medical causes. Parasites, allergies, skin infections, hormonal imbalances, localized pain and cognitive dysfunction are all potential problems causing the OCD behavior. Obviously, diagnosis is important to your pet's well-being and targeted treatment is the way to clear up symptoms, including the obsessive licking. In addition, if your dog is obsessively licking herself, your vet can check for lick granulomas, dangerous and painful sores that can develop from repeated licking.\nYou may be inadvertently reinforcing your dog's obsessive licking. If she licks people excessively and you take it for affection, you probably praise her, pet her and bestow affection on her in return. This sends the message that her licking is good and will earn her rewards. Alternatively, if your dog obsessively licks items or surfaces and you or others in your home think it's funny, you may be laughing and otherwise offering increased attention in response to the behavior. This too only serves to spur it on.\nYour dog's obsessive licking may very well result from boredom, so provide more attention and stimulation. If you leave her crated, shut away in a room or alone outside for significant periods, stop. Play with your pet more, take her for more walks and take her out to different places. Increase her daily exercise and supply puzzle toys and other entertaining items for when she's on her own. Consider signing her up for a doggy daycare or some sort of canine class in your area for variety and more socialization, especially if you're short on time for her. Arrange for a dog walker or dog sitter if necessary.\nObsessive behaviors, including licking, often come about from stress and anxiety. This is particularly likely if your dog wasn't properly socialized as a puppy. Work on socialization to build up your pet's adaptability and resistance to stress; doggy daycare and other programs provide good opportunities, as do trips to the dog park or play dates with a friend or family member's dog. Schedules and routines are important for a dog's mental health, so stick to them, and positive reinforcement-based training also provides much-needed structure. Try dog-appeasing pheromone or canine aromatherapy products to calm your pet when there's noise, visitors or other environmental stimuli that may be stressful. Talk to your vet about anti-anxiety medications and supplements, too.\nThe Dog Trainer Quick and Dirty Tips: What Should You Do About Your Dog's Obsessive Licking?", "version": "v0"}

Gonzalez, president and co-founder of the nonprofit Mexicanos Primero, spoke passionately about the importance of education reforms. Mexicanos Primero is a non-partisan organization advocating for improving public education for young Mexicans.\nGonzalez gave several statistics on education and educational outcomes, comparing overall time spent in school, average years of schooling and graduation rates around the world. For instance, Mexico\u2019s high school graduation rate sits at 47 percent for 2014, below the United States\u2019 79 percent and far below Germany\u2019s 95 percent. Average years in school for Mexican children is under nine years, lower than the United States\u2019 average of 13 years, and Mexican students spend an average of 900 hours in class each academic year, or 4 \u00bd hours a day. That\u2019s almost half the time spent by Korean students, the highest ranked group.\nGonzalez then presented two goals and four solutions for education in Mexico: catching up with the world in both quantity and quality of education by putting the government in charge, by the professionalization of the teacher force, by increased transparency and efficient spending on education, and by school autonomy and participation.\nPositive steps taken so far under the government reforms, he said, include mandatory exams for potential teachers followed by regular assessments and professional development, an autonomous evaluation organization for schools and teachers, and the creation of the nation-wide System for Education Information and Management, in part to resolve corruption.\nFormer California Senator Denise Moreno Ducheny serves as the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies\u2019 senior policy advisor. In her welcome remarks, she touched on the importance of education for productivity and quality of life in our cross-border region, highlighting the continued momentum around binational cooperation here on the border and the increased collaboration among universities, companies and elected officials in our region.\nThe dean of UC San Diego\u2019s School of Global Policy and Strategy, Peter Cowhey, said the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies continues to play an important part in cultivating a strong political, cultural and economic relationship between the two countries. USMEX is based at the School of Global Policy and Strategy.\n\u201cThe center has truly a distinguished history,\u201d Cowhey said. \u201cIt was created in 1979 and the centerpiece, the crown jewel of its programs, has been its fellows program.\u201d With more than 600 research fellows in residence to date, the center has played a valuable role in providing a \u201csafe and deeply principled\u201d space for policy choices for both Mexico and the binational relationship, he said.\n\u201cThis has created, if you would, the largest and strongest network of analysts of Mexico and the bilateral U.S.-Mexico relationship in either country,\u201d Cowhey said.\nThe complete Mexico Moving Forward: Recapturing the Mexico Moment will be broadcast on UCSD-TV and includes three panel discussions ranging from an economic discussion featuring Carlos Capistran, a UC San Diego alumnus and the chief Mexico economist at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch, to a look at how civil society is transforming Mexico with Jose Merino, director of Data4 and professor at the Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico.\nFollowing the discussions, attendees were treated to a Dia de Los Muertos celebration with traditional Mexican food, decorated altars and a live mariachi band.\nLearn more about the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at UC San Diego.", "version": "v0"}

Wednesday, with the Democrats\u2019 election triumph not a day old, Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions, setting off a potential constitutional crisis. He named DoJ Chief of Staff Matt Whitaker as Acting Attorney-General, who has a long history of hostile statements towards Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s investigation \u2013 including advocating defunding and imposing limitations on the probe. Now, more than ever, a functioning democracy requires Democrats and Republicans to come together to take action \u2013 next week \u2013 to protect Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s investigation. Because if we don\u2019t, and Donald Trump is given license to shut down an investigation into his own potential wrongdoing, then our nation starts to devolve into a banana republic.\nThis is a serious issue, but we won\u2019t let it completely distract from what did happen on Tuesday. On Election Day, voters across the country braved the cold, and the rain, and hours-long lines for the chance to fulfill their civic duty. I visited my first polling place of the day in New Haven at 6am and went town to town all day. I saw a passion and excitement for voting that I haven\u2019t seen in a long time.\nIt was a good night for progress \u2013 and for the checks and balances the Founders wrote into the Constitution. Democrats won back the House of Representatives, made historic gains in governor\u2019s races, and state legislatures across the country, and held our own in the Senate, battling the toughest map we\u2019d ever seen. We\u2019ve heard for eight years that undemocratic gerrymandering meant it would be impossible for Democrats to retake the House majority before redistricting \u2013 that was once conventional wisdom, but the voters weren\u2019t listening.\nNow, there\u2019s a whole industry of cable news pundits and political spin doctors who will all have their own explanations for what happened. I\u2019m here to tell you to tune all that noise out, take a step back from refreshing Twitter, and focus on what actually matters.\nOn the ground, out here in America, this election was about, more than anything else, health care.\nWashington Republicans spent all of 2017 trying to rip up protections for patients that were put in place under the Affordable Care Act. Republicans were blind to the 20 million people who got health care \u2013 who never had it before the ACA, all they saw was President Obama\u2019s name on it.\nBut even though Republicans had control of the White House, the Senate, and the House of Representatives for 24 months, they couldn\u2019t do it. Why? Because, to people out here in America, the politics don\u2019t matter. The Affordable Care Act helped them, and people rose up and stopped repeal. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\nBut, of course, that didn\u2019t mean the Republican attacks on our health care stopped \u2013 far from it. Donald Trump has systematically sabotaged the underpinnings of the American health care system, jacking up costs and gutting benefits for people when they get sick. Republicans are still coming after your health care through executive orders, perverse new rules coming out of the Department of Health & Human Services, and piles of lawsuits in hopes that the courts will do what Congress couldn\u2019t.\nAnd all of that set the stage for last Tuesday. People \u2013 they are pissed that Republicans care so much about taking away their health care. Let\u2019s face it, there are some things so fundamental to daily life that they transcend politics and partisanship. Health care is one of those things. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re a conservative or liberal, doesn\u2019t matter whether you voted for Trump or Clinton. You want health insurance that covers what you need it to cover, that will be there for you in an emergency, and doesn\u2019t cost more than you can afford. It\u2019s that simple.\nI heard the same thing at polling places on Tuesday, that I heard when I walked across Connecticut this summer \u2013 health care was the most important issue. An exit poll showed that health care was the #1 issue, and it wasn\u2019t even close.\nThanks to the victories across the country, Democrats in Congress are now in a better position to stand up for your kids, your parents, your neighbors, your friends. Congressional Republicans have a choice to make now: continue down their path of sabotage or work with Democrats to lower health care costs and expand access to quality care. If Republicans continue to sabotage your health care, we\u2019ll stand up against their efforts to hand control of your health care over to the insurers who frankly see sick people as a liability, not as patients who can get better with the right care. Democrats will do everything we can to make sure that pre-existing condition protections are here to stay, and we will try to use our new power to take the next steps, like taking on the drug monopolies and forcing down the exorbitant costs of prescriptions that still threaten to bankrupt many Americans and the U.S. Treasury.\nBut the success of our health care system \u2013 it isn\u2019t just up to us. You have a role to play, right now.\nOpen enrollment for health insurance is here! If you are uninsured or you don\u2019t get your insurance through your employer, go to healthcare.gov \u2013 today \u2013 to shop around and pick the health insurance plan that fits the needs and the budget of you and your family. Do your research \u2013 just be sure to pick a plan by the deadline of December 15th.\nEverything that I, and my colleagues in the Senate and the new Democratic House majority do to defend patient protections will be meaningless if you don\u2019t go out and make sure you have health insurance. So, do it. It\u2019s easy, and it\u2019s the single best thing that you can do to protect you and your loved ones for 2019.\nOh, and one last really important thing. We get to take to the streets to protect the Mueller investigation, we get to have these arguments about the future of American health care, because we live in a democracy, where everyone gets a say. And so, remember that this Sunday, Veterans Day. Tuesday\u2019s vote represented a dramatic shift in power, in Washington and all across the country. But remember that millions of people across the world never get to vote in an election. Thank a veteran this weekend, because they made sure that we can.", "version": "v0"}

It has hundreds of parts working together and when the rub against each other it creates friction. The most damaging factor of friction is the massive amount of heat it produced, which can ruin your engine. That\u2019s why oil is such a major factor to a running engine. Oil has two jobs in an engine, to lubricate the engine and cool parts as it circulates.\nIf your engine were to run out of oil, the moving parts would create so much heat the engine would seize up. This can happen in a matter of minutes after running out of oil. Once your engine locks up there is no way to undo the damage, instead you\u2019re shopping for a new engine. With this in mind we can all agree that oil is a very big factor in a working engine. Running out of oil isn\u2019t the only problem you may encounter, using the wrong oil or using oil for a long period of time my greatly reduce its effectiveness. Debris including dust, particles and dirt can work their way into your engine and your oil. Most oils contain additives to help clean the engine and prevent rust. Changing your oil regularly ensures you have clean oil designed to keep your engine in top working order.\nRegular maintenance tasks, like oil changes, are the best ways to keep your engine running well.

Seen in this light, food preparation and service touch everyone on a regular basis. More important are the foodborne illness outbreaks when food preparation is not tightly controlled from product contamination or less-than-ideal site sanitation.\nOccupational safety can help on many levels to keep things running well, from the full-time safety professional on site to the purchased, or online, self-completed program to cover the needed regulatory standards.\nThe goals of food service safety are exactly the same as those for any other occupational safety and health facility. The only differences will be defined by the workforce and management interest and follow through for achievement. Your efforts, whether a sole proprietor or a corporate safety guru, are dictated by the time, planning, and attention to detail you provide. Add in highly controlled consistency, and you have a winning program in the making.\nKnow your business and the hazards associated with it. Before you start operations; conduct your facility assessment for hazards. If unsure, search the web, purchase preprinted monthly inspection forms, ask your insurance carrier or risk management specialist for assistance, and visit www.osha.gov to find helpful items for the beginner. Make a list of hazards, and update it often.\nKnow the inherent hazards of food preparation, including a key one, slick floors from water, grease, or product spillage. One of these can turn a walkway into a ski slope and a disaster site in the making. Utilize safety mats or customized or readily available floor coatings to increase slip resistance, texture, and ease of cleaning. Insist on and then require adequate foot protection for the work being done. Enforce your foot protection policy and efforts. You have to reinforce \"everyone is responsible\" so that any employee who finds something wrong (such as a slick area on the floor) must report it. This will reduce injuries. It takes time, but every effort saves lost work time and worker's comp costs.\nKnives, saws, and packaging machines are everyday tools of the trade. You'll deal with them by using cut- and puncture-resistant gloves, aprons, protective footwear, hair coverings, hearing protectors, temperature protection clothing, ergonomic hand tools, and pneumatics and lifting/transfer aids, among others. In warehousing, forklifts and loading dock safety are front and center, along with eyewash and drenching units and Hazard Communication. Know what your company has on site and how to use it so you can train employees on how to utilize it properly. Make a list and keep your certifications current for forklift, lockout/tagout, and other required training; you'll find that www.osha.gov has a comprehensive list available.\nSanitation efforts. My favorite example is when the nighttime cleaning crew runs out of cleaner/sanitizer and refills the containers with water. (After all, who will know?) The bad news is that this was done by three crews! Moral of the story: Neat may not mean clean. Enforce food safety, handwashing and cleaning techniques, and chemical safety. Check and review the purchases for your cleaning chemicals and hand cleaners. Make sure what you order and what your employees actually use are the same thing and is approved for food preparation! You may be surprised at the low amount being replenished and what that may mean in a required clean working environment. Few industries have as much immediate ability to make a lot of people sick as a facility that sends out a contaminated or spoiled food product. This breaks the public trust and brings huge liability home to that company in follow-up investigations.\nHow about pest control and the chemicals being used? Are they approved for food production and service areas? Can you pull and have available your documentation, SDS sheets, and training signed sheets, and can you justify every effort you have made?\nOrganization and documentation drive the industry. Is your work site well set up and organized? Do employees replace items? What about records\u2026can you instantly pull employee work training records, PPE records, health testing where needed, permits, and repair requests? Is every employee going through the exact same process from day one until fully qualified?\nFire safety and general knowledge of fire prevention. Check every exit to make sure it is open, accessible, clearly labeled. Teach fire safety from the ground up, starting with trash and rubbish accumulation and disposal and including flammable chemical use and storage, electrical safety, ground pins on machinery, damaged cords, \u201crigged\u201d electrical, and homemade connections. Regularly inspect for clear aisles, storage of flammable items, your sprinkler system (if your site has one), hood extinguishers, (including how to really clean up after a hood extinguisher system is activated. As you think about food preparation oil and grease for cooking, how about smoking guidelines?\nWhen things go wrong, make sure managers and lead employees have a well-thought-out backup plan or know what to do in emergency situations. Post emergency numbers and the site address. Policies need to be specific to the problem, such as requiring product disposal in the event an employee is cut and bleeds onto it, a bin turns over onto a non-sanitary floor, etc. Just ask the big companies that have nationwide product recalls what a headache those can be for public relations, safety, employee morale, and the bottom line. Emergency management situations might be cooling/refrigeration units going down, power outages, spoiled product issues, wrong deliveries, and the ever-present clever employee horseplay on site (causing something to be destroyed). It was not long ago that an on-site maintenance employee repaired a hose to a cooker improperly; it broke, spraying into the cooker flame, and caused the Imperial Foods chicken processing plant fire and multiple deaths. All of this could have been prevented.\nAsking for assistance. Is there a call list for anything from an HR issue to emergency repairs and even an employee's death from an injury on site? How should they respond to an OSHA inspector walking in or the local FDA or sanitation inspector? You need to know before the final report shows up that someone is on your site.\nOn-the-job injuries and worker's compensation. Keep track of what employee injuries are really costing you, including replacement workers, medical costs, final impairment ratings, etc. Track how the injuries happen and target those areas for more intensive follow-up. If it is in a code area with which you are unfamiliar, admit it and find a good consultant. A well-qualified consultant can save you thousands of dollars and hours of your personal research. Do be specific on what you will pay for.\nTrain, train, train. Don't expect any employee -- whether a high school part timer, a well-qualified manager, or a recently released felon -- to know instinctively what you want and the high standards of safety you demand in his or her everyday activity. From the new employee orientation to task-specific training to intensive supervision and documentation, know what each employee is doing and how he/she is progressing in task management and safety. Conduct team meetings and safety committee meetings, and ask questions often when you walk through. Know what is going on in your area of responsibility and make needed improvements or changes quickly.\nFood service is high traffic, transient, and hard to track. Employee turnover is often very high among populations that may have a wide mixture of educational backgrounds, language barriers, and employee apathy. With the economic situation, budgets are slashed or non-existent.\nFocus on the important areas of safety as a starting point and continue expanding. This will not be an instant fix, often not an easy fix, but developing a consistent model that educates every employee from day one the exact same way will greatly enhance your final lowered injury and product loss rate and will send your employees home safe and sound. Safe public exposure and safe employees are complementary and fully achievable goals.\nThis article originally appeared in the February 2013 issue of Occupational Health & Safety.\nLinda J.

There is a lot you can do at home, but if you\u2019re not experienced and confident in your skills, then taking a class will be one of the best investments you can make. For around $100, you can learn a few basic skills that will change your years with your dog. A well-trained dog and an out-of-control dog are two different creatures. Which one you end up living with is up to you.\nHere are a few things to keep in mind when you are training your dog. First of all, it is better to master a few fundamentals than to teach many different commands in a mediocre way. If you have a dog that will come when called, sit on command, and stay there, and will do it reliably, then you have a well-trained dog. A dog that \u201ckinda\u201d knows 50 commands if you can get its attention, is not a well-trained dog. The point of obedience is to have a dog under your control at all times, so that you can curb destructive behaviors, keep it out of danger, and prevent the nuisance factor.\nWhen you do learn the techniques for a few basic commands, the important thing is to practice them over and over, in increasingly distracting situations. It\u2019s no big deal to get your dog to come when you call if you\u2019re in the house alone. It\u2019s a completely different thing to call your dog back from a busy street after you\u2019ve dropped the leash and a cat has just run across the road, dog in hot pursuit. You must carefully control the training situations, because if you set the dog up for failure by unrealistic expectations, you will weaken the discipline of training, not strengthen it. So don\u2019t take your dog to the dog park and try to call it to you a week after you start training this command.", "version": "v0"}

If one stays within the pathway created by the lines of the safety tape they will safely exit the 75,000,000 year old trap; this assuming they can pay the $360,000+ toll to traverse the vast expanse of the trap.\nLet\u2019s do the math on LRH\u2019s exactly taped path out of the trap. The pathway is very narrow. To be specific, it is three feet wide ( 0.9144 meter) and bounded on either side by yellow and black safety tape. Thus, we divide 47,000,000 million feet by two. By dividing and converting to miles, we find the exactly taped pathway out of the trap is 44,508 miles in length (71,629 meters).\nGiven the length of the exactly taped path, there is a lot of auditing to do to make it through the engram-laden swamps of the Reactive Mind and the Walls of Fire which comprise the OT Levels. Get to work Scientologist! You have a long way to go to get out of the trap!\nSo yer tellin\u2019 me that if I mind my Ps & Qs and stay exactly in the middle of this eternity granting 3 foot wide path and then I turn sideways and with another intensive of GAT II auditing I blow 3 feet outta my head then I will be off the path and doomed to thralldom forever? Surely there must be an appropriate sum to donate to the IAS to prevent such a tragedy!!!\nYours is an excellent question and one answered by the IAS. Wogs falsely believe the IAS gives Scientologist large and gaudy trophies because Scientologists are attracted to expensive bright and shiny objects that confer unearned prestige upon them. While this correct, the more fundamental reason is physics: If the Scientologist ties his or her large and gaudy IAS trophies to their meat sacks, then these trophies will act as protective ballast.\nHence, the $1 million dollar IAS Patron Bloviatus Trophy is guaranteed to serve as a counterweight when one is blown up to sixty feet out of their heads. The smaller $40,000 IAS beginners trophy offers only three feet of protection.\nGiven the power of GAT II auditing, we in RTC recommend that all Scientologists minimally ballast themselves with the $500,000 Patron Moronous trophy which will keep you on the exactly taped path when you are blown 25 feet out of your head.\nThank you Sir!!!!! Although I have never come close to blowing anywhere out of my head as a result of my flawless GAT II auditing on ARC Straightwire, I don\u2019t want to take any chances. Maybe by the time I finish, that will happen.\nLet\u2019s just call IAS Status upgrades Theta Insurance. Thetans just outside the exactly taped path are just fucked. Thanks to LRH, COB and the IAS we have a chance to get out of this trap and stay in a better one.\nTo get to Oz, Dorothy followed the yellow brick road. But the yellow tape path for Scientologists leads to bankruptcy, divorce, destroyed families, and slavery.", "version": "v0"}

In this research, the use of detailed mathematical models for the optimal design of membrane systems is investigated. Mathematical models of hollow-fibre and spiral-wound membrane modules are presented in this thesis. The models are developed from rigorous mass, momentum and energy balances and can be used to describe a generic membrane separation. This is in contrast to most existing models which are typically process specific and are only valid within a limited operating range. The generality of the new approach is demonstrated by application to gas separation, pervaporation, and reverse osmosis case studies. Simulation results for these systems show excellent agreement with published experimental data. The thesis also introduces an optimal design strategy for membrane separation systems. This strategy is characterised by two main features: firstly, detailed models are used. This is essential if sub-optimal and inaccurate solutions are to be avoided. Secondly, an optimisation technique based on genetic algorithms is implemented. This provides multiple solutions, allowing the user to interpret the results and make a more informed decision. The feasibility of the optimal design strategy is investigated using two realistic case studies. In the first study, the optimal design of reverse osmosis desalination plants is considered and the use of both hollow-fibre and spiral-wound modules is examined. The results of this study compare favourably with work published in the open literature and highlight the importance of using detailed models to describe membrane separation systems. In the second study, the use of pervaporation for ethanol dehydration is investigated. An existing pervaporation plant is evaluated and a significantly improved design is found.\nThesis digitised by British Libray EThOS.

Examples of these stresses include high unemployment; an overtaxed or inefficient public transportation system; endemic violence; or chronic food and water shortages. By addressing both the shocks and the stresses, a city can better respond to adverse events and is more capable of delivering basic functions in both good times and bad, to all populations.\nPresident of 100 RC, Mr Michael Berkowitz, disclosed that out of the over 1,000 applications received across three rounds of selection process, Lagos was chosen for its innovative leadership, infrastructural strides and influential status not just in Africa but in the world. Receiving the plaque of admittance on behalf of the state, Lagos State Governor, Akinwunmi Ambode stated that \u2018this is a great honor, and a further affirmation that Lagos has become a reference point when it comes to initiating and executing pacesetting innovative and strategic policies and programmes that are meant to uplift the living standard of the people\u2019.\nSPACES FOR CHANGE staff participated in the agenda-setting workshop which brought together a diverse group ofstakeholders including state officials, city and community leaders, service providers, businesses, and non-governmental organizations. Through a range of facilitated exercises and group discussions, workshop participants learned about the concept of Urban Resilience and began the process of identifying and discussing the city\u2019s resilience-building priorities. During this session, SPACES FOR CHANGE discussed how the inequalities in the distribution of urban infrastructure as well as the exclusion of the city\u2019s most vulnerable populations\u2013such as slumdwellers\u2013in urban decision-making produces the sort of stress that need to be addressed. An estimated population of over 21 million people live on Lagos\u2019 3,577 km\u00b2 land mass (22% of which comprises lagoons and creeks) causing significant strain on the city\u2019s infrastructure and social fabric. The state\u2019s ability to respond to adverse events and shocks in both good times and bad is threatened, absent an inclusive resilience strategy that addresses these stark inequalities and strains.\n100RC aims to help Lagos State become more resilient through the provision of four major resources, which includes a Chief Resilience Officer (CRO), who will lead the city\u2019s resilience efforts. The CRO will lead efforts to develop a resilience-building strategy or roadmap, over the course of six to nine months. Lagos State also stands to benefit from the inclusion in the 100RC Network, through which CROs can share best practices, solve problems collectively, and learn from each other and from other resilience experts.", "version": "v0"}

Mainstream media is rife with examples of trans men and women speaking out about their journey, their experiences and their hopes for the future.\nMuch of the focus is on younger people as the up and coming generation of trans activists. But there\u2019s an entire community of older people who have either been quietly living under the radar or hiding their true selves. These people have now found they are able to live openly and honestly \u2013 some for the first time ever in their life.\nIn an effort to give these voices a platform photographer Jess Dugan has released her latest project, To Survive on This Shore. Dugan worked with social worker Vanessa Fabbre, traveling across the country to interview and photograph older trans and gender-nonconforming people from all walks of life.\nThe project has given people a chance to prove it\u2019s never too late to make the choice to live authentically. The project not only helps older trans and nonconforming people, it also offers inspiration to younger generations. Many young trans people have never seen images of older trans people and they often feel as though that makes their own future feel even more uncertain. Being able to see older trans and non-binary people who are happy, confident and willing to be a part of such public projects proves there is true happiness that comes from living honestly.\nDugan also notes that part of her inspiration for the book was the abundance of bad news when it comes to mainstream stories about trans or non-binary people. \u201cI worried their stories were at risk of being lost or forgotten, and I wanted to record and preserve them,\u201d Dugan said, and she has reason to worry. Older people and the elderly are some of the most marginalized people in the country. They\u2019re often overlooked and underrepresented in the media. While they are often overlooked now, the truth is that many of them helped to quietly change minds, open hearts and pave the way for greater acceptance.\nThe fact of the matter is that trans and non-binary people have always existed. At various points in history there have been some cultures that make room for these people in their mainstream cultural norms. Navajo culture recognized dual genders as do some sects of native Hawaiian culture while modern day Indian and Taiwan cultures continue to acknowledge and even celebrate gender fluidity) But in the West \u2013 and especially in the United States \u2013 the gender roles have a history of being much more rigid. That has effectively erased trans and non-binary people from history, but that doesn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t exist.\nTo Survive on This Shore is a project that adds to the history of our nation and our culture. By sharing their stories these people share their strength, their insight and their accomplishments. They offer a unique point of view often having lived through extremes in terms of cultural attitudes and social mores.\nThe project became a book which was released in August of 2018 and is now available through Amazon.", "version": "v0"}

From the very beginning, other companies and institutions have also taken advantage of the good infrastructure of Lufthansa\u2019s training center in order to hold conferences and meetings of their own. The most famous example is the so-called \u201cSeeheimer Kreis\u201d \u2013 an association of SPD members of the German Federal Parliament \u2013 that was founded there in 1978 and used the conference hotel until 1984.\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, the building was expanded and renamed the \u201cKlaus-Bonhoeffer-Haus\u201d.\nBonhoeffer was the syndic and manager of Lufthansa\u00b4s legal department from 1935 to 1945. Social issues interested him from an early point in his career. He was influenced by the thoughts of Max Weber and had close ties to his brother Dietrich who played a central part in the church resistance to the Third Reich.\nIn a period in which technological development achieved enormous progress, justice and the rule of law in Germany experienced a downturn of a magnitude previously unknown. Deep outrage about this state of affairs drove Klaus Bonhoeffer into the resistance against the national-socialist regime. He was arrested during the Nazi purges after the failed assassination attempt on Hitler and executed on April 23, 1945.\nIn times of growing competition, Lufthansa once again declared professional development to be a strategic factor. The \u201cLufthansa School of Business\u201d, Germany\u2019s first \u201cCorporate University\u201d, trained both young professionals and management personnel.\nBut in the new millennium, the demands on learning increased rapidly. In 2006, rather than embark on a costly renovation of the more than 30 year-old building, Lufthansa decided in favour of a more economical new building at the same location \u2013 and invested around 100 million euros.\nAfter two years of construction, the Lufthansa Training & Conference Center Seeheim opened its doors in early 2009.

Plunge the tomatoes in a pan of boiling water for 30 seconds. Drain immediately and peel tomatoes. Cut each in half crosswise and squeeze out most of the seeds. Dice the tomatoes.\n2. Heat the ghee or oil in a heavy frying pan over moderate heat until it is hot but not smoking. (If you use mustard oil, bring it to the smoking point for about 5 seconds to make the pungent oil docile.) Drop in the black mustard seeds and fry until they turn gray and sputter. Add the curry leaves, and in seconds carefully add the tomatoes and saffron. Stir and cook for about 15 minutes over moderately low heat.\n3. Add the candied fruit, diced green fruit and salt. Stirring often towards the end, cook for about 15 minutes or until fairly thick. Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the fresh coriander, and let cool. Serve at room temperature, or cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days.\nBring all to a boil and simmer for about 5 hours, stirring occasionally. The mix should thicken and turn golden brown. Put in bottles and store for at least 3 months.\nA simple cooked chutney with tomatoes and apples -- This is a family recipe, originally from my grandmother.\nfrom Jeanne Lesem's \"Preserving in Today's Kitchen\"\nCore the tomatoes, seed and stem the green peppers, and peel the onions. Cut the tomatoes and onions into chunks, and pulse/chop all three vegetables in a food processor to a coarse texture. Transfer the prepared vegetables to a 1 1/2 quart bowl (not aluminium), stir in the salt, and let stand 8 hours or longer. Drain, rinse, and drain again. Place the vegetable mixture in a wide 2 1/2 to 3 quart saucepan, add the sugar, spices, and vinegar, and simmer about an hour, or until thick, stirring occasionally. Add the horseradish during the last 5 minutes of cooking. Pour into jars and store in refrigerator or freeze.\nStore a week or two before serving. This recipe is easily halved.\nPeel the onions and tomatoes and slice thinly in a food processor. Peel and core the apples and slice thin in a food processor. Layer the onions, tomatoes, and apples in a 1 1/2 or 2-quart bowl (not aluminum); sprinkle each layer with some of the salt. Let stand about 12 hours, or overnight.\nThe next day, drain well, and puree the mixture in a food processor. Place all the ingredients except the food coloring in a wide 4-quart saucepan. Bring mixture quickly to a boil, stirring once or twice. Boil steadily about 30 minutes, or until mixture is almost as thick as bottle tomato ketchup. It will thicken more as it cools. Add the vegetable coloring, if desired. Pour into jars and store in refrigerator or freeze at least 1 month before using.\nIf its the same Guy Middleton, I think I know your source for the recipe, Miss Sphinx. I live about 2 miles as the crow flies from the U of Waterloo in Waterloo, ON. Small world. And looks like a good recipe. I snagged it. Thanks.\nI just made a cake like this and it was great. I am now trying to keep my tomatoes green a little longer just so I can make another one.\nSprinkle the salt over the chopped tomatoes and let stand overnight.\nIn the morning, drain and add chopped onion, celery and apples.\nMix spices with the sugar and add vinegar.\nAdd liquid to pickle mixture and simmer slowly for 1 hour.\nPour into hot jars and store in refrigerator or freeze.\nThere are few canned relishes and \"salads\" I like but this sure is one. It's really good and that's coming from someone who's a tad picky about stuff like this. The consistency of the liquid isn't thin, more sauce-like but there's no thickener in it at all. This is half of the original recipe and makes 7 half-pints. We like to try new stuff in smaller quantities in case we don't like it. This salad was made in late September when there were loads of green tomatoes to deal with.\n1. Wash all the vegetables. Cut each tomato in half, remove the stem part, cut the tomatoes into 1/3\" thick slices and put them into a mixing bowl.\n2. Grate carrots on the larger holes of a grater and add grated carrots to the bowl.\n3. Peel and cut each onion into quarters, slice quarters into thick slices and add them to the bowl. Don't slice too thin or they will become too soft during the canning process.\n4. Add the 3 TBS salt to the bowl of vegetables, mix well and cover with plastic wrap. Let the mix sit for 12 hours at room temp. Do this in the evening so that you can drain the resulting juice in the morning.\n5. In a pot large enough to hold the vegetables, mix together the canola oil, sugar and vinegar until the sugar dissolves. Add drained vegetables to the pot and mix to coat them with the syrup. Add the peppercorns and bay leaves. Cover and bring the pot to the boil and cook vegetables on medium high heat for 30 minutes, stirring 3 or 4 times.\n6. While vegetables are cooking, clean and sterilize jars and lids.\n7. When the 30 minutes are up, add the vegetables to each jar, packing them to eliminate any air pockets. Leave 1/4\" head space, wipe jar rims, add lids and process in a hot water bath for 10 minutes.\nMakes 7 half-pints. Refrigerate after opening.\nDo you rinse the veggies before cooking or leave the salt on them?\nDo you add the cooking brine to the jars after packing them with veg to 1/4 headspace?\nWhat is the texture and taste after processing?\nSurprised there is no fermented pickle recipe here. It's the default use for green tomatoes at the end of the season in all eastern Europe and probably more to the east as well.\n1. Take green tomatoes and add them to your jar (preferably a fermentation crock). Now the tricky part here is that for best taste and texture, it's best to use tomatoes that are just blushing. Too ripe and they might get mushy.\nThe greener they are the bitterer they become (like when seeds are not well developed yet). Also the texture might be like a hard sponge for some, which is not great imo.\n2. Add boiled water (boiled but cooled after) with salt (no additives in salt preferably). We use 5% salt in water.\n3. Add whole cloves of garlic, a decent amount, maybe a hot pepper.\n4. Some old dill plants with seeds added on top to cover the tomatoes.\nLet it ferment at room temperature for a week or two, can be moved to a colder place after that.\nKeeps better then cucumbers, because they're also more sour (more sugar in tomatoes I guess). Can keep 3-4 years if undisturbed easily.\nMy sister made this and I just asked her as the recipe itself says nothing about rinsing. She said she probably did not rinse because the recipe did not say to do that.\nthere are no air pockets in the jar after filling. Sister Pickles said she just ladled the stuff into the jars and then ran a chopstick around the edges to release any air pockets. That's her favorite tool for that job.\nThe taste is just a bit sweet but not a lot because you have the acid of the tomatoes to balance it out. So I'd say it's just a little \"sweet & sour\".

The \u201cscandal\u201d stopped being interesting many months ago, but there\u2019s an election coming up, and fundraising letters to be sent out, so Issa likely hoped a new hearing would serve some larger partisan purpose.\nIndeed, the California Republican seemed to have a plan: he\u2019d demand testimony from Lois Lerner, the former head of the IRS\u2019 tax exempt division; she would assert her Fifth Amendment rights; and Issa would share his righteous indignation for the cameras. It\u2019s a custom-made stunt for the right, generating plenty of \u201cIRS official takes the Fifth\u201d headlines.\nBut Issa just couldn\u2019t control himself. Instead of the political world chattering about a discredited controversy, everyone is now shaking their head about Issa cutting off microphones and refusing to let Democrats speak at the hearing. Issa stopped pushing the story and quickly became the story.\nThe conservative chairman soon after sounded like a man acknowledging defeat.\nAnd it\u2019s at this point that even Issa\u2019s Republican allies may have to wonder whether the committee chairman was the right person for this job in the first place.\nDana Milbank noted today just how \u201cunusual\u201d Issa really is.\nEarlier in his capricious tenure, he banned Democratic witness Sandra Fluke from a panel about birth control, leaving an all-male slate of witnesses and giving his Republican Party a major embarrassment. His hearings have been chaotic affairs in which he talks over members of his panel, and he has often discredited his committee\u2019s investigations by making incendiary accusations that turn out to be unfounded.\nBut there is no such proof. The evidence Issa is certain exists somewhere appears only in his imagination \u2013 alongside similarly strange allegations against the Democratic president the congressman keeps struggling to destroy.\nIssa is in his final year as chairman of the Oversight Committee, regardless of the outcome of the 2014 midterms.

Black tip reef sharks, blue spotted rays, puffer fish, chevron barracuda, all within a lazy snorkel from a beautiful beach? The island of Koh Tao, well known as the number one place to become PADI SCUBA dive certified in the world, does not disappoint snorkelers. Even Chris and I grab our snorkel gear on days off from teaching SCUBA to visit our favorite snorkel spots on Koh Tao, and I\u2019m about to divulge our favorites to you. Be sure to copy and paste this list onto your travel notes to help you choose where you want to base yourself on Koh Tao. Read on for the list of Koh Tao\u2019s 5 Best Snorkeling Beaches and all you need to know before you go.\nLong tail boat on Sairee Beach. Image by \u00a9 Alexander Ozerov. via Adobe stock.\nWhat criteria have we used to determine this list?\nFirst, we\u2019ve snorkeled (or SCUBA dived) them ourselves. Not every beach or bay we\u2019ve snorkeled on Koh Tao has made this list. Some have either limited aquatic life, the swim is too far from the beach, or they don\u2019t have a coral reef at all.\nSecond, each site on the list has a gorgeous beach that will take all of your stress away. You can relax in a hammock, kick back and listen to the waves, drink a beer, and forget that anything else exists except you and paradise. All but one of these beaches has budget-friendly, local accommodations, so you can even stay indefinitely just within a few meters of the beach.\nThird, beautiful aquatic life, including lush corals, sergeant major fish, butterfly fish, and in some places black tipped reef sharks, or barracuda may be seen within an easy swim of the beach. We know you want to see a living reef, so our emphasis here is on a combination of beauty in and out of the water.\nChris and I normally take our snorkel gear (mask, snorkel, and fins) along with us to these remote beaches. If you\u2019re a SCUBA diver, consider purchasing your personal snorkel set as part of your dive gear. You can get by with a mask and snorkel, as well, which is easier to carry. Aqua Master on the Mae Haad down road has a good supply (ask for Chris Burke\u2019s 10% discount). Otherwise, check with local dive operations to rent snorkel gear or to buy a set for keeps. Unless the location details below specify that you can rent snorkel gear there, it\u2019s best to rent needed gear prior to going to remote locations. Simply ask around on the main roads before you head off on your scooter to one of these beaches.\nWater, water, and more water. The salt water and sun will dehydrate you fast, so take plenty of water for each person.\nReef-safe sun protection. Rash guards, hats, and bandanas are best to preserve the coral reef. If you must use lotions or sprays, opt for reef-safe products. Apply them at least 30 minutes to an hour prior to going into the water.\nPack a lunch (except to Aow Leuk, where no outside food is allowed).\nKoh Tao\u2019s coral reefs will amaze and delight you. With your underwater camera, you will forget about everything but your amazing experience. Please, help us keep the reefs healthy by remembering to keeping fins, feet, and hands off of the coral and other marine life at all times. Try to keep your feet off the coral and rocks, which will protect you from cuts and the reef from damage. Use reef-safe sun protection rather than lotions or sprays that kill the corals. Please take out all trash to a recycling station or trash bin.\nReady? Here\u2019s our list of Koh Tao\u2019s top 5 best snorkeling beaches.\nSnorkeling on Koh Tao delights travelers seeking a remote island experience. By Anake. Adobe Stock.\nWhite sand beaches, crystal blue waters, two gorgeous reefs on either side of the bay make Aow Leuk a fantastic beach to visit for snorkeling. Standing from the soft-sand beach, you\u2019ll have a hard time believing that what you\u2019re seeing really exists. Between the two reefs on either side of the bay, you\u2019ll see a gently sloping, white sand shelf that\u2019s perfect for a relaxing swim or just playing with friends. Just before noon, the water takes on the most incredible blue color that you may have thought only existed in super-saturated photography. But it\u2019s real. For its amazing beauty and abundant life, Aow Leuk easily takes #1 on our list of Koh Tao\u2019s 5 best snorkeling beaches.\nWalk out into the water, slip on your mask and fins, and head to either side of the bay for a beautiful snorkel. On the right side (south), you can snorkel quite far, even to the next little cove \u201cHing Nom,\u201d where the snorkeling will mesmerize you. Be sure not to go too far if your swimming skills aren\u2019t up to par. It\u2019s possible to tire yourself out by going too far.\nWhat will you see snorkeling Aow Leuk?\nIn addition to my favorite snorkel fish, the sergeant major fish, you can also see butterfly fish, puffer fish, crocodile needle fish, pink anemone fish on lush anemones, and more. Chris and I have seen black tipped reef sharks here, both juvenile and an adult. Don\u2019t worry. Black tips are shy, so you\u2019re very lucky to see them. Just relax and take in their majestic beauty.\nYou can access Aow Leuk easily by scooter via a paved road on a steep hill that ends in a dirt parking lot just off of the beach. You\u2019ll see a shack at the entrance to the beach, where a Thai local may ask you to pay 100 TBT per person to visit Aow Leuk. A few local, Thai families have claimed ownership of the land on the beach, and one particular old man has a reputation for occasionally being rude or demanding. These families also require that you not bring any outside food or drink to Aow Leuk, which really isn\u2019t necessary considering that a few affordable restaurants exist for you to visit. It\u2019s worth paying the baht for a half day in this paradise on Koh Tao. And if you\u2019re really tight, read on for our favorite spots that require no fees. Read on for #2 of Koh Tao\u2019s 5 Best Snorkeling Beaches. Want to SCUBA Dive instead? Choose your SCUBA Adventure here.\nTanote Bay\u2019s coral reef thrives with abundant marine life right from the shore.\nChris and I occasionally teach PADI SCUBA courses from Montalay Dive Resort, conducting confined sessions in the pool and shore dives on the thriving reef, so we\u2019re very familiar with the local vibe and the reef. For its gorgeous reef, beautiful beach setting, and sunrise view, Tanote earns #2 on our list of Koh Tao\u2019s 5 best snorkeling beaches.\nWhat will you see in Tanote?\nLife, life, and more life well within a few meters of the surface and perfect for snorkeling. You\u2019ll discover beautiful snorkeling from either side and in the middle of the long beach, but be prepared to walk gingerly if you don\u2019t have booties. Like Au Leuk, you\u2019ll see tons of sergeant major fish, butterfly fish, wrasse, parrot fish and much more. Venturing out just past the boulders, it\u2019s possible to see schooling barracuda, but you don\u2019t need to go very deep. The calm water of Tanote invites marine life very close and well within an easy swim. Honestly, you never know what you\u2019ll see on this reef.\nWant more excitement? Take a plunge from the boulder into the crystal waters below! Quite often, you\u2019ll see people climbing to the top of the boulders just off shore with the line rigged to the beach-facing wall. Once on top, they walk straight towards the sea to the points farthest from the beach and make the plunge into the crystal waters below. Chris and I have not done this, and we think you\u2019d be nuts to do it unless you snorkel and check out the site first.\nOnly two years ago, the long, winding, downhill road to Tanote was unpaved and treacherous. It took quite a bit of skill to ride a scooter or motorcycle down the hill, and uphill was no better. Nevertheless, the this quiet (family-oriented) resort beach developed by way of pickup trucks who transported (and continue to transport) visitors to and from the pier on the other side of the island. In the last year, locals paved the long road, making it much easier to reach Tanote bay (still not so easy for those who\u2019ve never driven a scooter).\nBecause taxis charge at least 300 TBT to get to Tanote from Mae Haad, you\u2019ll need a scooter to get here. The resorts do not charge any fees to access the beach, but you\u2019ll need to park your scooter in a resort lot. We prefer the Montalay Resort lot because it\u2019s easy and directly visible from the road. Once parked, you\u2019ll walk through the resort down to the beach. No one pays attention, and you may even like the looks of the restaurant and pool for a bite and a swim (again, no one seems to pay attention, especially if you grab a bite or drink).\nYou can rent snorkel gear from Montalay Dive Resort, which is right next to the swimming pool. You\u2019ll find another, more laid back option to eat a bit down the beach on the right (south). Just don\u2019t order their iced coffee: stick with beer, fresh coconut, or fruit juice.\nUnlike Au Leuk, Tanote\u2019s beach is coarser, not as white, and it doesn\u2019t extend into the bay. Instead, the reef comes very close to the shore, so you\u2019ll need to look for sandy areas to wade in, put on your mask and fins, and swim carefully over shallow corals. This becomes much more difficult if the tide is out, but it is still possible. Note, be careful of long tail taxis come and going from the bay, as they are not very careful, and their long props are incredibly dangerous. Read on for #3 on our list of Koh Tao\u2019s 5 Best Snorkeling Beaches. Want to SCUBA Dive instead? Choose your SCUBA Adventure here.\nMango Bay\u2019s stunning blue water and gorgeous white sand beach make for a relaxing a memorable day of snorkeling. By Igor Tichonow, Adobe Stock.\nMango Bay makes our list of Koh Tao\u2019s Top 5 Snorkeling Beaches for its sheer beauty. At the northernmost point of the island, this white-sand beach and crystal bay provide swimming-pool-like conditions when other bays may face into heavy winds. Another gorgeous beach with blue waters, it\u2019s one of my favorite places to take new SCUBA divers. Coral reefs line both sides of the bay, with a pristine beach and a sloping shelf of white sand extending well into the bay, making a beautiful place for swimming, snorkeling, and SCUBA diving. In fact, it\u2019s so popular that you may prefer either of the next two locations on our list. But for its beauty and aquatic life, Mango Bay takes #3 on our list of Koh Tao\u2019s 5 best snorkeling beaches.\nWhat will you see snorkeling Mango Bay?\nLife on Mango Bay\u2019s coral reefs continues to thrive with areas of the reef suffering from layers of sedimentation that appear to be smothering some coral. Nevertheless, life finds a way, and divers will see an abundance of reef life, including butterfly fish, parrot fish, puffer fish, eels, blue spotted sting rays and more. You will also see SCUBA divers who use the shallow water to train new divers. If you prefer an isolated beach, see Sai Nuan or Laem Thian.\nNo fees are charged to visit Mango Bay, but forget trying to drive a scooter. The best ways to get to Mango Bay is by long tail taxi. The road to Mango Bay has not been finished, and treacherous driving is an understatement. A couple of years ago, I took my Kawasaki dirt bike to Mango Bay and recall riding through what must have been a creek bed, over palm fronds and broken coconut husks. I wouldn\u2019t advise it for the average traveler. For the adventure hearted (and physically fit), you can try trekking to Mango Bay, but it\u2019s so much easier (and prettier) to take a long tail taxi. If you plan to stay in Mango Bay, the resorts may run trucks back and forth to Mae Haad. If you try to hike there, take plenty of water and snacks.\nYou may also be surprised that Mango Bay has limited food available, with only one restaurant and prices that are higher than average on the island. Avoid disappointment by taking your own lunch and plenty of water. Then, splurge on beers at the resort. Read on for #4 on our list of Koh Tao\u2019s 5 Best Snorkeling Beaches. Want to SCUBA Dive instead? Choose your SCUBA Adventure here.\nSnorkel Sai Nuan beach then settle in for an amazing sunset. By Madison, Adobe Stock.\nSai Nuan beach rests facing west into the sunset, and although the reef has suffered and does not present the healthiest snorkeling spot on the island, the location itself is gorgeous, and the swimming is excellent. Walk out into the water and head to the right side and around the corner to find the healthiest reef life. Head towards the three rocks jutting out of the water if you have the swimming skills. If you head to the left from Sai Nuan, go around the rocks and explore along the boulders if the water is calm. Although the reef is not as healthy as the other locations on this list, the beauty of this location and its amazing sunset views earn it a solid #4 on our list of Koh Tao\u2019s 5 best snorkeling beaches.\nNearby Sai Nuan, you\u2019ll find another small beach, June Juea Beach, which is even quainter and still beautiful. Explore the coral reef between the two beaches to see parrot fish, wrasse, and lots of interesting marine life clinging to the corals and rocks.\nRecently, the resort owners at Sai Nuan have put up a sign notifying visitors of a fee to visit the beach. Arriving by long tail may get you out of the fee, but you\u2019ll pay for the long tail. The journey by land to Sai Nuan can also be tricky, as the Thai locals have not yet paved the worst part of the downhill road. The easiest way to get to Sai Nuan is by scooter (for a somewhat experienced driver) and then to park at the top of the hill where the paved road ends. Once parked, walk down the dirt road, through the June Jeau resort and north towards Sai Nuan resort and beach. Read on for #5 on our list of Koh Tao\u2019s 5 Best Snorkeling Beaches. Want to SCUBA Dive instead? Choose your SCUBA Adventure here.\nEscape the crowds; snorkel Laem Thian on Koh Tao. Copyright Halie Rebeccaschild, 2018.\nLaem Tian beach will delight travelers looking for a private beach experience. Accessible only by boat or an hour hike through the Koh Tao jungle, the small, white sand beach slopes out gently onto a coral garden. From the beach, an easy swim to the right or left leads to healthy corals with an abundance of life, including sergeant major fish, butterfly fish, puffer fish, and more.\nThe remoteness of this location means very few visitors to share the space with you, so you can delight in the privacy and beauty of this coral reef. For its healthy and abundant coral reef, and its location which allows visitors a private beach experience, #5 earns its place on our list of Koh Tao\u2019s 5 best snorkeling beaches.\nIf you enjoy exploring and a bit of climbing adventure, wander behind the resort and up the peak to a gorgeous overlook with a beautiful stand of firs that overlook the sea. Take your hammock and eat your lunch up top for a truly private experience in paradise. Just remember to give yourself at least an hour (in decent weather) to hike out.\nThe hike in to Laem Thian requires some sturdy shoes (or cautious foot placement). You should also pack in water and a meal just in case you want to stay a while. It takes about an hour to hike from the trail head at Sairee to Laem Thian at a steady pace. You\u2019ll need the Koh Tao guide and a basic map to get you there. Chris and I believe figuring out how to get to Laem Thian is part of the journey to this unique backpacker\u2019s destination. We also hope that people who visit Koh Tao actually stay long enough to catch the vibe, which is just about long enough for you to figure out how to make it to Laem Thian. And if you still can\u2019t figure it out, have a long tail drop you off and hike out on the dirt path when you\u2019re ready.\nCheck out our video \u201cHike to Laem Thian\u201d for a glimpse of our recent visit to this remote destination before you go.\nLaem Thian beach was once a private beach resort, and the remains of the resort still stand in a state of decline. People from around the world have come and left their mark on the resort walls with spray paint, which isn\u2019t the prettiest sight. Laem Thian does, however, make the perfect spot for a beach fire pit or a drum circle with friends. Be sure to pack in everything you need and take out everything you brought. Please leave behind everything else but photos.\nComing to Koh Tao to SCUBA dive? Want to SCUBA Dive instead?

If you are having problems accessing the Nintendo eShop, we ask that you try again at a later time.\nThis year wasn\u2019t the first \u2014 and certainly won\u2019t be the last \u2014 year we\u2019ve seen company servers taken down by unanticipated consumer demand (or, for that matter, hackers simulating as much through saturation-based service assaults, the principle being the same). The spotlight\u2019s been on Healthcare.gov since it launched, because hey, political football, but the truth is that demand-related catastrophes impacted all sorts of majors in 2013, from Sony and Microsoft\u2019s respective online services when the Playstation 4 and Xbox One arrived, to Rockstar when it launched Grand Theft Auto Online on Grand Theft Auto V\u2018s heels (the game didn\u2019t work as intended for weeks). Wherever you have something a bunch of people want to use, and it\u2019s an online something, you can pretty much expect access to be sporadic or glitch-riddled until demand evens out.\nWhy don\u2019t companies build server farms capacious enough to accommodate demand? Because these spikes are anomalies in the longterm life of a service, and building permanent solutions is cost-prohibitive (it\u2019s basically asymmetric overkill once demand settles down). You\u2019d think companies might construct temporarily mongo-sized clusters, say leasing performance they just divest themselves of later, but whatever they\u2019re doing today, it\u2019s not working.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t expect them to square this particular circle, or that glitchy launches are okay, but for now, I expect we\u2019ll see this sort of regular irregularity continue through 2014 and beyond.", "version": "v0"}

You can read between the lines when you see that AT&T is quoted first in the press release, Verizon second. Good news is, Ducks fans will have better cellular no matter which of the two major carriers they are a customer of.\nWe haven\u2019t heard yet from AT&T about whether or not the conference is fully covered with DAS yet \u2014 according to this news report from last year there were only four Pac-12 schools whose DAS wasn\u2019t up to snuff, with Autzen clearly being one of them. We are trying to get AT&T and Pac-12 folks on the line for a general update, so stay tuned.\nMoving to the other side of the Rose Bowl rivalry, AT&T announced it had installed a DAS at the University of Minnesota\u2019s TCF Bank Stadium, a network of 339 antennas that will also be used by Minnesota Vikings fans since the NFL team is also playing there this year and next while their new stadium gets built.\nAccording to AT&T, fans at TCF Bank Stadium used 106 GB of data on the new network during the Gophers\u2019 Aug. 28 home opener against Eastern Illinois.", "version": "v0"}

Here they passed near the two largest container cranes at the port.\nThe Oakland Airport Aviation Museum hosted Mike and son-in-law Blake on an adventure outing.\nMike and Blake recently traveled to Sacramento for an afternoon game of the Rivercats AAA-league baseball team. (The Rivercats are the \"farm team\" for the San Francisco Giants.) This is a smaller stadium, and a more casual, \"family friendly\" atmosphere.\nSon-in-law Blake and Mike traveled to Sacramento to visit the California State Railroad Museum in Old Town Sacramento.\nMike and son-in-law Blake's adventure trips go practically everywhere. They recently visited a nearby \"waste water treatment plant.\" Here's Blake inspecting one of the aeration basins.\nMike and son-in-law Blake not long ago visited San Francisco's cable car power house (this is what moves the cables under the streets that actually move the cable cars!).\nMike and Blake visited Mare Island Naval Shipyard, where they took in a museum highlighting the 100+ years of the Naval shipyard's history, and toured a WWII navy ship, one of the heavily armed \"Mighty Midgets,\" built to support amphibious landings in the Pacific theater.\nMike and Blake toured the new Levis Stadium (\"home of the 49'ers!\") and museum. A beautiful facility (easy to see why the tickets are expensive!).\nMike and son-in-law Blake visited the huge Budweiser brewing plant in nearby Fairfield a while back. Turns out not many people work there, as the plant is almost entirely automated.\nMike and Blake went to the Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve in nearby Antioch, with a highlight being a tour way underground in the Hazel-Atlas mine. This area is honey-combed with old mines, some which produced coal, and some, like the Hazel-Atlas, high-silica sand used to make glass. This mine was in operation until 1949.\nBlake & Mike visited the battleship Iowa while it was docked in Richmond for some restoration work before being towed to LA to become a floating museum. The Iowa was on active duty from 1943 to 1990.\nMike and son-in-law Blake recently visited the Computer History Museum in Silicon Valley, and before that, the new Bay-side quarters of the Exploratorium Science Museum in San Francisco. Here they are at the Exploratorium - lots of cool exhibits here, many \"hands-on.\"\nMike and Blake visited the Golden State Model Railroad Club in Point Richmond - this includes over 10,000 square feet of intricately detailed train layouts, towns, mountains, etc. Trains run every Sunday afternoon, and visitors of all ages are welcome!\nMike and Blake went over to Jack London Square in Oakland to see the yacht used by FDR when he was President. The Potomac has been completely restored, and one can just take a quick tour, or as Mike and Blake did, sign up for a 2-hour cruise around the Bay. The cruise was great, and the ship's historic surroundings and displays added to a fun day.\nMike and Blake had another adventure trip to visit the SS Red Oak Victory ship, which is part of the \"Rosie the Riveter\" National Historical Park in Richmond. This cargo ship was built at the Kaiser Shipyards in Richmond in 1944, and later saw service in both the Korean and Vietnam conflicts.\nJust past Sacramento is the Folsom Power House, a water-driven electricity generating plant right below the big Folsom Dam. It was one of the first on the West Coast.\nAnother Mike and Blake adventure was a visit to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to tour the \"National Ignition Facility\" where the only research in the country on generating electricity by nuclear fusion is going on -- a huge building full of one-of-a-kind high-tech machinery. No cameras were allowed inside the fence, so we settled for a picture by the entrance gate.\nMike and Blake traveled up to Sacramento to visit an aerospace museum at the former McClelland Air Force Base. While the museum and its exhibits and planes were interesting, maybe the really unique part of this day was lunch at the old Officers Club - we tried to look like we were roughing it, but it was hard to do !\n\"The Excellent Adventures of Mike and Blake\" continued when Son-in-Law Blake surprised Mike recently with a tour of a HUGE castle (which also happens to be a winery) up near St. Helena. This castle has over 100 rooms spread over some 120,000 square feet.\nMike and Blake have traveled to many destinations over the years. Not long ago, Mike and Blake headed for San Francisco, stopping first for lunch at an old Herb Caen institution on the waterfront called Red's Java House, a hole-in-the-wall hamburger joint right under the Bay Bridge. Then they toured the Anchor Steam Brewery, and learned the fine points of making beer. There was some tasting involved, but I'm not posting pictures of that !\nEarlier, Mike and Blake went to an air museum at the old Castle Air Force Base, where they got to see 40+ aircraft, including the SR-71 and a B52.\nMike and Blake have also toured the Jelly Belly Factory in Fairfield, and rode an old train at the Western Railway Museum near Travis Air Force Base.", "version": "v0"}

The dowry had all the hallmarks of a \u201cpremature bequest\u201d utilised by a bride\u2019s father to make provision for his daughter during his lifetime rather than upon his death ensuring that the \u201cfamily property\u201d is preserved intact for male heirs and descendants.\nThe Hindu Succession Act 1956 provided women with rights of inheritance and was the first legislative provision which sought indirectly to eradicate the abuses and excesses of the dowry system and to obviate the need to provide a dowry. The 1956 Act proved unsuccessful in its objective resulting in the passing of the Dowry Prohibition Act 1961 (subsequently amended by the Dowry Prohibition (Amendment) Act 1986) which made it a criminal offence to provide or receive a dowry. However, the dowry has proved difficult to eradicate and the tradition continues under the guise of \u201cwedding presents\u201d which are not prohibited by legislative provision. The provision of a dowry is akin to the importance attached to \u201cstatus\u201d by Asian families raising the family in the community\u2019s esteem \u2013 this entrenched practice is as prevalent today as it was historically.\nDid the bride take a dowry with her?\nWhat is the legal position in relation to jewellery and/or clothes and/or money given to the bride on the celebration of the marriage emanating from the bride\u2019 s family and the bridegroom\u2019s family?\nWhat is the legal effect of jewellery and/or clothing which passed from the bride\u2019s family for the groom and his family?\nHow does the bride get her jewellery back?\nWhether the Court is satisfied on the evidence on a balance of probabilities that all items forming part of the \u201cdowry\u201d have been returned by the bridegroom and/or his family on the breakdown of the marriage to the bride?\nIf the Court is satisfied that the bridegroom and/or his family have retained the \u201cdowry\u201d and/or parts of the \u201cdowry\u201d whether it is satisfied as to its value thereof for the purposes of a lump sum order and/or to grant an order for its return to the bride?\nThe legal and evidential burden of proving not only that she was given a dowry but also what she was given rests on the bride. How can the burden be discharged?\nIt is the usual practice to video the wedding ceremony including the traditional ceremonies at which gifts are exchanged: the engagement ceremony (karmi or sagan) and the first visit of the bride and groom to the bride\u2019s parents\u2019 home after the wedding ceremony (milni).\nIn addition, photographs are taken of the jewellery and all gifts are openly displayed including the gifts emanating from the bridegroom\u2019s family.\nThe marriage mediator (barchola,barchole) would have played a pivotal role in the negotiations as to what gifts should be given usually with the provision of lists. The mediator\u2019s evidence is relevant in the event that it is alleged that the bride was not provided with a dowry and/or the dowry\u2019s composition. Receipts recording purchases should be sought and/or an expert jeweller\u2019s opinion obtained on possible valuation of jewellery where no receipts are in existence. These are not required as \u201cessential documents\u201d in the Form E under the Ancillary Relief Rules but a District Judge may order a short narrative Affidavit in the event of a \u201cdowry\u201d dispute if a Final Hearing is necessary where negotiations and/or attempts to settle at a FDR hearing prove fruitless.\nTo deal with the legal position pertaining to dowries it is relevant to consider the English law governing wedding presents and on paraphernalia as well as Commonwealth Indian cases which are of persuasive authority insofar as they shed any light on how an English court should resolve and/or adjudicate on dowry cases.\nIt is a principle of law that a gift must be considered by reference to the intention of the donor but there is no principle of law applicable to wedding presents that they become the joint present of the spouses.", "version": "v0"}

Now that I'm over a year out of University the academic year doesn't affect me but I do look forward to the Food Festival which falls on a Friday, Saturday and Sunday at the end of Fresher's Week. I've been going to the Food Festival since 2015 (I wrote a blog post about my experience in 2016), so it's a tradition that started at University, and when I read online that the festival was back from another year, I knew that I wanted to keep the weekend free so that we could head down there for lunch on the Saturday or Sunday. We actually went to the festival yesterday and had a fabulous time despite the rain, so today's post is going to be dedicated to our experience and the food we ended up getting to try.\nWe arrived at Dane John Gardens at half 11 and even at this time, crowds of people were piling into the festival. The layout was pretty much the same as other years, with 4 different areas of stalls and some seating areas between them. There was a bandstand and music area too where local artists were entertaining hungry festival visitors. Kent has a lot of food producers with it being the 'garden of England' and Canterbury itself has lots of independent restaurants and cafes who choose to exhibit at the Food Festival, so there were a vast number of stalls to visit. With my camera in tow we did a loop of the festival to see what food and drink was on offer this year. I highly recommend you doing this before purchasing anything as you might miss a stall that takes your fancy, if you purchase some food as soon as you walk through the gates.\nAfter we'd had a glance at the whole area, we decided to walk up to the top of the mound in the gardens to see the festival from above. This was Stuart's idea and a very good one too as we got to really appreciate the sheer size of the festival from the top of the mound. It also wasn't raining at this point so it was the perfect opportunity to get some photos.\nWhen we were back down inside the festival it was time to choose some lunch options. Stuart had bao buns from The Korean Cowgirl: a restaurant on the King's Mile in the city centre and I opted for rosemary fries from the Moroccan and Lebanese stand. Normally I would go for Mexican or Greek cuisine as both of these are my favourite, but we weren't having our main meal at the festival so I didn't want something too heavy going. The rosemary fries were delicious though and at only \u00a32, a real bargain at the Food Festival! Most food items cost between \u00a36 - \u00a38, which is more expensive than other years, but the Food Festival is a special event to have in the city and if a small price hike ensures that the event comes back year on year, I'd rather that any day.\nI'm a tea and cake fan so when I saw the bakeries and cake stalls at the festival, I knew that I wanted to take a sweet treat home for later in the weekend. One particular cake company called Gateau Mini sold mermaid and unicorn themed cakes. Their 'rainbow fudge' was so pretty and colourful that I just had to purchase some. After taking it home and trying some, I can now say that it is extremely sweet but very good fudge. It's novelty foods like these that the Food Festival is so great at showcasing; you wouldn't be able to find rainbow fudge at your everyday high street bakery.\nAfter we'd eaten the rain started getting heavier and seeing as we'd spent over an hour there, we decided to head back into town and shelter from the rain. We left the gardens feeling full and content, as once again we'd had a really good time at the festival.\nIf the festival happens again in September 2019 and you don't live too far from Kent, why not organise a day trip to Canterbury when the festival is on? The food is always delicious and the event atmosphere is fantastic.\nHave you ever been to Canterbury? It's a brilliant city for foodies.", "version": "v0"}

Photography courtesy Hank Gilpin.\nNestled in a diverse New England forest in Hingham, Mass., is the 300-acre Boston Golf Club. At the end of a weaving, copper-streetlight-lined driveway rests a modest clubhouse and pro shop. Seemingly built into the land and clad in wood siding and shingles, the exteriors evoke the intimate feel of New England mountain cottages, while the interiors showcase white oak and at least 15 other native hardwood species.\nFounders John Mineck and Rob Ketterson didn\u2019t meet while golfing, but while serving on the board of the Boston Society of Arts and Crafts. They learned that they not only shared an appreciation for wooden furniture, but also a passion for old-school golf\u2014the building blocks of Boston Golf Club.\nInspired, after touring 10 East Coast golf clubs with builder Hans Schaefer and project manager and master woodworker Hank Gilpin, the men set out to build a relaxed place to enjoy golf and a beer without the feel and frills of a typical country club.\nFormed by a glacial stream, the rugged, tree-covered land pitched in every direction; an unruliness that attracted Mineck. Other golf course architects would have flattened the land, but Mineck asked course architect Gil Hanse to be as non-invasive as possible. As a result, Hanse created naturally flowing, undulating fairways, with rugged bunkers. Mineck and Ketterson also requested that wood harvested on site be used in construction wherever possible. All other lumber was to be native.\nOverlooking the 18th green is the 8,000-square-foot clubhouse. It is divided into a series of spaces that include a grill room, bar, billiard room, library, and the women\u2019s locker room. While smaller than some clubhouses, the extensive use of hardwoods perfects the intimate feel that Mineck desired.\nWhite oak was used throughout the grill room and bar area, because according to Gilpin, \u201cwhite oak flooring provided the durability required to stand up to the abuse of golf shoes in a high-traffic area.\u201d The bar, also fabricated from white oak, was topped off with wooden tap handles. Gilpin made seven custom tables of varying species and sizes; a 15-foot-long white oak built-in counter; and a 22-foot-long table that spans a wall of windows, crafted from a single red oak felled at the 9th hole, along with handmade maple stools.\nThe pro shop and men\u2019s locker room are located in a separate building and offer even greater variety and creativity. Red oak is a staple of the pro shop\u2014utilized as flooring, cabinetry, the counter, and display tables. In the men\u2019s locker room, each of the bays features a different species of wood: ash, cherry, maple, red oak, or white oak. All 130 lockers include framed door panels, with plain, rift-cut stock of the same species for the stiles and rails. \u201cWe also repurposed granite blocks from a local church for an outdoor shower in the men\u2019s locker room,\u201d added Gilpin. Stacked chest-high for privacy, the quirky amenity allows anyone using the shower to look out onto the 18th green.\nFast-growing tulip poplar was incorporated into trim and ceilings because of its workability and modest weight. Catalpa was used as exterior vaulted ceilings, paneling, and signage. Along the course, bridges and raised wooden paths were made from white oak and black locust. \u201cBlack locust is extremely hard, resistant to rot, and long lasting,\u201d added Gilpin.\nGilpin and Mineck used sustainable strategies but chose not to seek certification. In addition to minimizing the disturbance to the land and utilizing local resources, 200 trees that were displaced by construction were transplanted.\nA 22-foot-long table spans a wall of windows with handmade maple stools.

The other common factor between the two cities is that they both went through devastating and destructive civil wars that remain in their recent history and psyche. The latter encouraged the former; when citizens of both cities lived through the daily threat of bombardment, the local nightlife industry boomed, taking clubbing to an art form. When the sound of battle subsided, the sound of DJs became louder, allowing a hedonistic social scene to get the global recognition it deserved.\nMarko Savic, one of Belgrade\u2019s key nightlife dynamos, is owner of Belgrade At Night and involved with Mikser Garden, a bar / design centre that is at the very heart of Savamala district; he says \u2018\u2018the city is more alive than any other.\u2019\u2019 Mikser is also central to the district\u2019s renaissance as a creative hub, as the former warehouse area of the bar exhibits the work of young designers that one can peruse whilst listening to the DJ play a classic set of 80s tunes amongst revellers outside.\nSavic buzzes around the hipster crowd, joining clusters of young and beautiful Belgradians who are kicking their night off at Mikser before going to party into the early hours on the river boat clubs. One of the most popular nightclubs is Lasta, which pulsates with light and energy on the quayside. Savamala is \u2018\u2018alternative rather than bohemian,\u2019\u2019 remarks Savic, which reminds me of a Serbian version of London\u2019s Shoreditch. Just around the corner Berliner Bar spills revellers on to the pavement, and bunting zigzags from building to building in preparation for a beer festival. The vibe is cool, relaxed and representative of a young dynamic population.\nNeighbouring the hipster bars of Savamala the Belgrade waterfront development along the Sava riverbank, comprising of hotel, residential and commercial space, is defining the future. A model of the new development is housed within the Geozavod (Belgrade Cooperative Building), one of Savamala\u2019s and Belgrade\u2019s most beautiful architectural monuments, built between 1905 and 1907. It is ironic that the Geozavod now showcases the new waterfront architecture, because during the early 20th Century when the building foundations took shape, Serbia was a country demanding a renaissance in architectural style. Today, the Savamala district headlines a new spirit of design and innovation and will become the gleaming face of the capital\u2019s future.\nThe city is \u2018\u2018compact and everywhere is reachable,\u2019\u2019 Savic says, reminding me that the Bohemian quarter nearby is called \u2018\u2018Skadarlija\u2019\u2019 \u2013 or Skadarska Street \u2013 and is no ordinary avenue. The simple gradient of winding cobbled alleys in the heart of Belgrade has always been the centre of life, popular with urban bohemians. The traditional Kafanas (bar and restaurants) have inspired many of Belgrade\u2019s actors, poets, directors, painters, musicians and writers, but fundamentally, this is a place for music, dance and celebration. The care-free attitude can be seen on sign boards standing in front of bars, offering \u201cFree Jokes, Free Hugs, Free Advice \u2013 Beer Is Paid For\u201d which keeps a smile on the face of tourists and locals alike. The cobble stones give an indication of how Serbia may have looked in the 15th Century under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. Belgradians fondness towards \u2018\u2018Skadarlija\u2019\u2019 has preserved it from encroaching redevelopment.\nWhen the sun rises, the place to head for is Kalemegdan Citadel, Belgrade\u2019s indefatible fortress. Centuries ago it was a defensive stronghold perched high above the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers and now is described as the heart and lungs of the city. The ancient walls, arches and ramparts still watch over the city and waterways, but with soft and tranquil eyes. The Citadel is Belgrade\u2019s largest park and is an oasis of open verdant spaces, with pine trees shading the wooden benches that capture a rare breeze and a little peace in one of Europe\u2019s most vibrant and energetic capitals.\nFor more information, go to www.serbia.travel.", "version": "v0"}

The day that Apple users finally get a dedicated smartwatch that takes a more focused approach to their own ecosystem. People laughed, they cried, and some even threw their money at the screen during their viewing of the live stream while others may have just simply thrown up. We realize this isn't news about Android, but then again this isn't a complete breakdown of the Apple Watch either, it's simply an outside look at how it might stack up against the likes of the Moto 360, the G Watch and other smartwatches.\nNo doubt some people are completely happy with everything that the Apple Watch has to offer, from the design of the frame and the customization of the bands and the case, to the user interface. You might be a user that is more than slightly underwhelmed by what you've been presented with and that's OK. Here's just a few short tid bits about the Apple Watch. It's sporting a sapphire crystal display which will help to keep it protected from light damage. Watches are easy to ding on stuff, like against tables, counters, walls etc. It's also said to be accurate within 50 milliseconds, and surprise, surprise, it'll be iOS compatible only. It starts at a $349 pricing, which is quite honestly around the price that many people expected the Moto 360 to cost. There will also be three models of the watch, the standard Apple Watch, an Apple Sport Watch, and a special edition model. There is no word just yet on exact release dates, or which model costs what price. So far we also have no details on battery life, or what all it has the capability to do, but you can bet there will be a suite of apps meant for interfacing with people's devices, and of course expect to have all the wellness and fitness related features you see in other smartwatches.\nCompared to other smartwatches out on the market like the Moto 360, the price seems a little steep especially if the starting cost ends up as the price for the base model. The Moto 360 starts at $100 less, or $50 less if you opt for the steel band. From personal experience, our own Alex Maxham is having an OK time with its battery life, so long as the Ambient Display feature isn't used too much. It'll be interesting to see how long of a charge the Apple Watch holds. Other smartwatches like the Gear Live and now the LG G Watch are priced under $200 and can last at least a day on a single charge, making them more of an affordable option for those that want a smartwatch, although, they too are compatible with Android only just like the Apple Watch is with iOS products. For the most part, if you're in the market for a smartwatch it really breaks down to what you want. So far most smartwatches are an extension of our handsets, simply providing notifications to things. There are a couple of options like Samsung's Tizen powered Gear lineup does have a selection of apps, and the Apple Watch likely will too, but should you decide the Apple Watch is what you've been waiting for, be prepared to fork out more cash than every other option.", "version": "v0"}

The present study aimed to capture the transmission dynamics of measles by employing a simple mathematical model, and also forecast the future incidence of cases.\nMethods: Epidemiological data that consist of the date of illness onset and the date of laboratory confirmation were analysed. A functional model that captures the generation-dependent growth patterns of cases was employed, while accounting for the time delay from illness onset to diagnosis.\nResults: As long as the number of generations is correctly captured, the model yielded a valid forecast of measles cases, explicitly addressing the reporting delay. Except for the first generation, the effective reproduction number was estimated by generation, assisting evaluation of public health control programs.\nConclusions: The variance of the generation time is relatively limited compared with the mean for measles, and thus, the proposed model was able to identify the generation-dependent dynamics accurately during the early phase of the epidemic. Model comparison indicated the most likely number of generations, allowing us to assess how effective public health interventions would successfully prevent the secondary transmission.\nIntroduction: In South East Asia, mosquito-borne viruses (MBVs) have long been a cause of high disease burden and significant economic costs. While in some SEA countries the epidemiology of MBVs is spatio-temporally well characterised and understood, in others such as Myanmar our understanding is largely incomplete.\nMaterials and Methods: Here, we use a simple mathematical approach to estimate a climate-driven suitability index aiming to better characterise the intrinsic, spatio-temporal potential of MBVs in Myanmar.\nResults: Results show that the timing and amplitude of the natural oscillations of our suitability index are highly informative for the temporal patterns of DENV case counts at the country level, and a mosquito-abundance measure at a city level. When projected at fine spatial scales, the suitability index suggests that the time period of highest MBV transmission potential is between June and October independently of geographical location. Higher potential is nonetheless found along the middle axis of the country and in particular in the southern corridor of international borders with Thailand.\nDiscussion: This research complements and expands our current understanding of MBV transmission potential in Myanmar, by identifying key spatial heterogeneities and temporal windows of importance for surveillance and control. We discuss our findings in the context of Zika virus given its recent worldwide emergence, public health impact, and current lack of information on its epidemiology and transmission potential in Myanmar. The proposed suitability index here demonstrated is applicable to other regions of the world for which surveillance data is missing, either due to lack of resources or absence of an MBV of interest.\nIntroduction: Determining the potential risk of foodborne illness has become critical for informing policy decisions, due to the increasing availability and popularity of unpasteurized (raw) milk.\nMethods: Trends in foodborne illnesses reported to the Centers for Disease Control in the United States from 2005 to 2016 were analyzed, with comparison to state legal status and to consumption, as estimated by licensing records.\nResults: The rate of unpasteurized milk-associated outbreaks has been declining since 2010, despite increasing legal distribution. Controlling for growth in population and consumption, the outbreak rate has effectively decreased by 74% since 2005.\nDiscussion: Studies of the role of on-farm food safety programs to promote the further reduction of unpasteurized milk outbreaks should be initiated, to investigate the efficacy of such risk management tools.\nIntroduction: The 2013-2015 outbreak of Ebola was by far the largest to date, affecting Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and secondarily, Nigeria, Senegal and the United States. Such an event raises questions about the circulation of health information across social networks. This article presents an analysis of tweets concerning a specific theme: the sexual transmission of the virus by survivors, at a time when there was a great uncertainty about the duration and even the possibility of such transmission.\nMethods: This article combines quantitative and qualitative analysis. From a sample of 50,000 tweets containing the words \u201cEbola\u201d in French and English, posted between March 15 and November 8, 2014, we created a graphic representation of the number of tweets over time, and identified two peaks: the first between July 27 and August 16, 2014 (633 tweets) and the second between September 28 and November 8, 2014 (2,577 tweets). This sample was divided into two parts, and every accessible publication was analyzed and coded according to the authors\u2019 objectives, feelings expressed and/or publication type.\nResults: While the results confirm the significant role played by mainstream media in disseminating information, media did not create the debate around the sexual transmission of Ebola and Twitter does not fully reflect mainstream media contents. Social media rather work like a \u201cfilter\u201d: in the case of Ebola, Twitter preceded and amplified the debate with focusing more than the mainstream media on the sexual transmission, as expressed in jokes, questions and criticism.\nDiscussion: Online debates can of course feed on journalistic or official information, but they also show great autonomy, tinged with emotions or criticisms. Although numerous studies have shown how this can lead to rumors and disinformation, our research suggests that this relative autonomy makes it possible for Twitter users to bring into the public sphere some types of information that have not been widely addressed. Our results encourage further research to understand how this \u201cfilter\u201d works during health crises, with the potential to help public health authorities to adjust official communications accordingly. Without a doubt, the health authorities would be well advised to put in place a special watch on the comments circulating on social media (in addition to that used by the health monitoring agencies).\nIntroduction: Following the initial outbreak of A/H1N1pdm09, periodic resurgences of the virus, with variable morbidity and mortality, have been reported from various parts of India including the temperate Kashmir region of northern India. An outbreak of A/H1N1 was reported in early 2015 across India with a high morbidity and mortality. We studied patients during the outbreak in Kashmir.\nMethods: Patients (n=1780, age 1 month to 90 years, median 35 years) presenting with acute respiratory illness to a tertiary care hospital in Srinagar, Kashmir from October 2014 to April 2015 were recruited. After clinical data recording, combined throat and nasal swabs were collected in viral transport medium and tested by real-time RT-PCR for influenza viruses. All influenza A positive samples were further subtyped using primers and probes for A/H1N1pdm09 and A/H3 whereas influenza B samples were further subtyped into B/Yamagata and B/Victoria lineages. Virus isolation, hemagglutination inhibition testing, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis was carried out using standard procedures. Testing for H275Y mutation was done to determine sensitivity to oseltamivir. All patients received symptomatic therapy and influenza positive patients were administered oseltamivir.\nResults: Of the 1780 patients, 540 (30%) required hospitalization and 533 tested positive for influenza [influenza A=517(A/H1N1pdm09=437, A/H3N2=78 with co-infection of both in 2 cases); influenza B=16 (B/Yamgata=15)]. About 14% (n=254) had been vaccinated against influenza, having received the NH 2014-15 vaccine, 27 (11.3%) of these testing positive for influenza. Sixteen patients, including 4 pregnant females, died due to multi-organ failure. HA sequencing depicted that 2015 isolates belonged to Clade 6B.1. No H275Y mutation was reported from A/H1N1 positives.\nConclusion: Resurgent outbreak of A/H1N1pdm09, with emergence of clade 6B.1, in 2014-15 resulted in high rate of hospitalizations, morbidity and mortality. Periodic resurgences and appearance of mutants emphasize continued surveillance so as to identify newer mutations with potential for outbreaks and severe outcomes.\nIntroduction: Chikungunya is an incipient disease, caused by Chikungunya virus (CHKV) that belongs to genus alphavirus of the family Togaviridae.\nMaterials and Methods: In this study, during an outbreak of CHKV in Dec 2016 in Karachi, Pakistan, samples were collected from patients presenting with fever, tiredness and pain in muscles and joints. Total 126 sera were tested for the presence of Chikungunya infection through ELISA and Real-time Reverse Transcriptase PCR assay.\nResults and Discussion: This study showed that approx 79.4% samples were positive for CHKV. To our knowledge, this is the first reported outbreak from last decades in which the presence of CHKV is confirmed in Karachi while affecting such large no. of individuals.. Conclusion: CHKV diagnosis should be considered by the scientists and clinicians as a differential diagnosis in febrile patients, and appropriate control strategies must be adopted for its surveillance.", "version": "v0"}

While we were at the Hong Kong Gem Fair in September we had the pleasure of meeting with Jacques-Christophe Branellec at the Jewelmer booth. Jacque told us he liked what we were doing on Pearl Guide and the had seen some of the photos posted on the Pearls of Joy Blog. After talking for a while he invited us as his guests to the Jewelmer 35th Anniversary Gala in Manila and to visit one of their pearl farms near their Flower Island resort.\nThe Gala was exceptional and a real treat to attend, for more on the gala read my full post HERE. The day after the gala we flew to Puerto Princesa on Palawan Island and made our way to the north end of the island, to catch a small boat that Flower Island sent to pick us up.\nThe friendly crew ready to pick us up and just one of the islands we passed on our way to the resort.\nAfter passing by dozens of uninhabited islands, beautiful cliffs and crystal clear water we pulled up to a warm welcome at Flower Island. The staff all came out to welcome us with huge smiles and cold drinks! Setting foot on the island truly took my breath away. Kevin and I have been to some spectacular islands around the world but Flower Island takes the cake. The locals know what a treasure they have and take care of it as such, everything was pristine. I really can't say enough about how well we were treated.\nAs luck would have it, we were the only guests on the entire island! We were completely spoiled. We stayed in a beautiful beach front cottage nestled between palm trees with a gorgeous healthy reef steps from our door constantly calling us into the water.\nKevin and I also took advantage of the stand up paddleboards with a cruise around the island each morning to work up an appetite for breakfast. Delicious meals were prepared for us three times a day using local ingredients and recipes -- including one dinner that featured \"pearl meat\".\nOne hot afternoon Kevin asked if they had any coconut water. \"Of course!\" one of the staff replied and climbed the nearest coconut tree, talk about fresh!\nOn the second day in paradise some of the staff loaded us on the boat and zipped us off to one of the peal farms. It was another warm welcome as our boat was pulling up. They were all waving at us with a big sign that they had printed our names on. What really struck me was how beautiful the area surrounding the pearl farm was, this tiny island could easily double as a resort destination.\nA small glimpse of the beautiful surroundings of Jewelmer's pearl farm.\nWe toured the whole operation and I was amazed at how many steps are involved from beginning to end in creating a pearl. I walked away with a new appreciation for the science and art behind producing beautiful pearls. There's a lot more to it then just putting a bead in an oyster and hoping for the best!\nThe farm was strict in preserving it's proprietary practices so a lot of areas including the hatchery were off limits to photography. The hatchery was where all the spat (baby oysters) begin their life-cycle and are bred from oysters selected for their potential to create beautiful pearls. While mother nature is still in charge, nothing is left to chance and they are constantly experimenting with new breeding techniques.\nWorker inspecting baskets containing juvenile oysters.\nThese baby Pinctada maxima oysters are then placed in the nursery where they stay for about two years. Once they have matured they are transferred to tanks and prepared to be grafted with a mother of pearl bead. The grafters take a piece of mantle tissue along with the bead and place it inside the oyster\u2019s gonad. It was fascinating to watch the grafters operate on these little oysters. The skill and precision it takes to cut into the right part of the oyster to place the bead and mantle tissue without harming the oyster is truly an art.\nThis oyster was chosen as a mantle tissue donor because of golden \"lip\" on the shell.\nOne of the grafters used to be a tattoo artist and because of his artistic talent and steady hands he was taught to nucleate the oysters.\nA few months following nucleation, the oyster goes through an x-ray machine to ensure it has recovered from its surgery and the nucleus wasn\u2019t rejected. Providing the nucleus is in the correct location the oyster is placed into small cages attached to lines to be dropped into the ocean for approximately two years. The staff, then carefully continue to monitor the many factors that affect pearl quality. They measure for things such as water temperature, water height, rainfall, salinity, and phytoplankton (oyster food!). Boats of workers go out each day to clean and adjust the heights of the lines to ensure the oysters are in the optimal condition for growing beautiful pearls. When the conditions are perfect and the implanted oysters have spent enough time in the water they do a small sample harvest. If they like what they see they will do a full harvest, if something is not right they will adjust the lines and give them more time in the water. Fortunately for us we were there as they were doing a pre-harvest sampling. As if on queue the first oyster yielded a beautiful perfectly round pearl with fantastic golden colors - something Jewelmer is famous for.\nBeautiful golden South Sea pearls - no dyes or treatments necessary.\nAfter the farm tour we were invited to snorkel around the farm and view the pristine underwater world necessary to grow world class pearls. Normally in aquaculture you see a dead sea floor, one covered in waste products and certainly not beneficial for the environment. But a pearl farm is different, a pearl farm requires pristine growing conditions and below the surface of the Jewelmer farm was teeming with colorful fish and bright vibrant coral gardens.\nThe underwater gardens surrounding the pearl farm.\nWith the pearl farm tour complete we opted to spend our last precious days in paradise simply lazying around and unwinding from a busy buying trip. The only downside was when it was time to leave, as \"post vacation depression\" is a serious hazard when leaving the Philippines. As we left the island Kevin and I both gave each other a look like \"we gotta come back\" and I'm sure we will soon.\nAmazing Flower Island Sunset on our last night in paradise.\nView ALL pictures on facebook by clicking below and don't forget to like our page for special facebook only offers!", "version": "v0"}

The right music can provide motivation to tackle the junk drawer or power through a presentation. It can create a festive atmosphere for a party or be an escape when your mind feels like it\u2019s filled to capacity.\nWith the advent of streaming, it\u2019s now easier than ever to create your own musical oasis. Many streaming services even do the heavy lifting for you by providing curated playlists for a variety of situations and musical tastes.\nI combed through the classical music playlists on Spotify (there are a LOT) and selected some of my favorites for when you need to clean the house, be productive, set the mood for a dinner party or soothe an overactive mind.\nThis playlist is a beautiful example of the adage \u201copposites attract.\u201d While the rule-breaking, improvisational nature of jazz might seem at odds with classical music, combining the two genres has surprisingly harmonious results. Whether you\u2019re simply tidying up the house or embarking on a Marie Kondo-esque purge, this playlist will help the work go faster.\nGive this playlist a try if you prefer arrangements that stay truer to the original compositions. The melodic genius of Bach shines on these tracks, and creative instrumentations (think light, airy classical guitar, soothing marimba and mellow brass) provide a fresh, modern feel.\nIn a world full of distractions, it can be nice to have an ally to help you find your \u201cflow.\u201d The music in this playlist is interesting enough to drown out distractions, yet mellow enough to not be a distraction itself. I\u2019d recommend listening at a lower volume if you\u2019re doing work that requires deep focus.\nThis fun playlist could appeal to a wide range of listeners. The pop songs play first, followed by their classical inspirations (so it\u2019s better to listen in order). Some of the pop songs are fairly literal versions of their classical inspirations, while others are extensive re-imaginings; a lot of them are surprises.\nThis collection of contemporary pop songs interpreted by classical musicians could also appeal to a wide range of listeners. Though die-hard fans of either genre might cringe at a few of the tracks, many of the arrangements are wonderfully imaginative.\nThe standout track in this playlist is a classical version of \u201cLose Yourself.\u201d Yes, the one by Eminem. I honestly expected to laugh, but as soon as I listened to it, it became one of my favorites. Vocal cadences can be difficult to translate into instrumental arrangements, and David Garrett and John Haywood have done this expertly. The track is, in a word, epic.\nWhile I can\u2019t claim that this playlist will completely get rid of restless thoughts, the short tracks and lively melodies will at least help get your mind off them.\nI hope this article inspires you to explore the many ways music can enhance your life and help you \u201cset the scene\u201d for finally cleaning out that closet, pushing through a tough project, spending time with friends, or just taking a break from the noise of modern life. Whether you have a subscription to a streaming service, make your own playlists, prefer CDs or records, or attend live shows, there are plenty of resources available to help you find music you love.\nSep 23 Hold my beer, and hand me my bassoon!", "version": "v0"}

Shooting it was like putting on an old well worn, well-formed pair of boots that had been custom fitted just by wearing them for a long time. I forgot how much I enjoyed that revolver \u2013 even if the cylinder latch and cylinder spin are backwards for some of you S&W fans.\nSince I don\u2019t reload, I gathered up a number of different 38 Special loads from different suppliers and then took them to the range to chronograph and make sure they made the 105,000 required power factor for revolvers. I figured that was the first step and then picking the one that shot the best groups would be the second step. I had; Aquila 130 grain, Winchester White Box 130 grain, Blazer Brass 125 grain, Blazer Aluminum 158 grain, Magtech 125 grain, S&B 158 grain, Remington Green & White Box 130 grain, and some 130 grain reloads from Ventura Tactical.\nTo make the power factor of 105,000 a 158 grain load would have to move out at 665-fps, the 130 grain loads at 808-fps, and finally the 125s at 840-fps.\nI was in for a heck of a surprise and thought the chrony was malfunctioning until I tested it with a couple of 9mm rounds from my Glock - it was correct. The temperature was about 60 degrees with a light overcast.\nAll of the 158 grains loads made the power factor, but only by about 20 fps. Absolutely none of the lighter weight rounds made the power factor, except for the Magtech 125-grain which exceeded the power factor by almost 60-fps. None of the others even made the manufacture\u2019s advertised velocity. I shot six rounds and averaged the speeds. Most of the lighter rounds missed the mark by as much as 80-fps and even the Winchester White Box, which I consider to be a slightly hot factory round, missed it by 15-fps. In addition the shot speed deviation on the lighter loads ran anywhere from 50-fps for factory to 145-fps with the Ventura Tactical reloads. None of this was what I was expecting. I should think any 130-grain factory load should at least move out at 850-pfs \u2013 which should clear the power factor floor by about five percent.\nI could tell the Magtech was a slightly hotter round when I shot it so I was not surprised it made the power factor and it shot a pretty good group \u2013 averaging 1&1/8th inch away from group center at 15 yards.\nAs experiment I place six of the Winchester Whit Box 130s in a towel with two of the open and shake type throw away hand warmers \u2013 and left them for about 20 minutes. When I took them out and tested them, they had picked up speed by about of 40-pfs \u2013 making the power factor. The odd thing was that each successive round seemed to chronograph at a slightly slower speed until the last few rounds \u2013 I suspect because the now cold cylinder was cooling the cartridges and then the cylinder heating up near the last two shots. Shots were about 20 seconds apart and were as follows; 890, 852, 831, 814, 816, 823. An average of 838-fps compared to an average of 793-fps when cold (but not really that cold). As you can see, dropping speed for the first four rounds, leveling off by the 5th round and then picking up a bit of speed with the last round. I well know that there will be deviations, but this seemed to be a pattern. I didn\u2019t have time to heat up any additional loads to see if I saw the same pattern. I can understand a temperature of sub 40 degrees having an effect on temperature sensitive powders, but was only about 60 degrees that day.\nHave any of you experienced something similar with factory 38 Special loads and such drops in velocity on a cool, not cold day?\nI don't have any experience with 38 special ammo but I did shoot rimfire metallic silhouette years ago. On cold days, we would put our ammo out in the sun on in a pocket that held it close to the body to warm the ammo. It seemed to increase the velocity and help with drop. When shooting a 22 standard velocity round a 100 meters, we needed all the help we could get to get the round to shoot at the sight setting for warmer weather.\nI've never chrono'd pistol ammo, but temperature change has an effect on muzzle velocity. A drop in temp will cause a drop in MV, more for some powders than with others. (And conversely, a rise in temp = a rise in MV).", "version": "v0"}

We\u2019re back to our regular posting schedule and you can look forward to our daily posts. To jazz up our apology, thought I\u2019d share a \u201clost and found\u201d poem I\u2019ve made from assembled graffiti spotted around San Francisco. Excuse the dubious image quality, all photographs were snapped on the go with my aging and tired phone.\nThe NY Times published a great Op Ed this past Friday called Why Do We Experience Awe? In it, psychologist professors\u2019 Paul Piff and Dacher Keltner cite studies that demonstrate the power of experiencing awe, \u201cthat often-positive feeling of being in the presence of something vast that transcends our understanding of the world.\u201d Experiences of awe are those that give you goosebumps.\nIn a series of studies, the authors found that awe is a \u201ccollective\u201d emotion that motivates us to be altruistic \u2013 to act in collaborative ways and care more for the greater good than for ourselves. In one study, people were either given a few minutes to look at awe-inspiring Tasmanian blue gum eucalyptus trees or to look at the facade of a science building nearby. Afterwards, an experimenter \u201cdropped\u201d a handful of pens. Those who spent the previous few minutes staring at the trees picked up more pens to help the other person.\nIn another experiment, participants who wrote about past experiences of awe or watched nature scenes for five minutes cooperated more and shared more resources.\n\u2026awe imbues people with a different sense of themselves, one that is smaller, more humble and part of something larger\u2026 fleeting experiences pf awe redefine the self in terms of the collective, and orient our actions toward the needs of those around us.\nOther research has indicated that awe is also beneficial for your health. One study found a strong correlation between experiencing positive emotions and low IL-6 levels, a molecule that promotes inflammation in the body. The stronger correlation was between levels of inflammation and having felt awe-struck.\nThe college students in their study reported feeling this \u201cawe-struck\u201d emotion 3 or more times a week, which is good news. Awe-inspiring experiences are out there if you look for them.\nPiff and Keltner worry that today\u2019s culture is awe deprived. The cite art, nature, and simple quotidian acts of humanity as places to find this awe and suggest that we more actively pursue awe-inspiring moments.\nIn a place like NYC, there are ample opportunities to find awe, if you take the time to look for it. Over the weekend I noted my own experiences of awe.\nOn Friday I visited the MoMA \u2013 a wonderful place to appreciate the beauty and wonder expressed upon a canvas. While there, I discovered a painting I had never seen before, entitled Hide-and-Seek by Pavel Tchelitchew (1942). This image is a game of hide and seek on its own, and the longer you stare the more images you find hidden in the canvas.\nI spent Sunday at Coney Island, where the old school amusement park, giant busy boardwalk, and aquarium provided countless experiences of awe. Luna Park is a place out of an earlier time, with old wooden roller coasters and traditional carnival games. It was a wonderful break from the modern-day technological world to co-experience the joy of more simple entertainment.\nOn the Coney Island Boardwalk, the colliding of cultures and experiences make for an awe-inspiring experience. There were dance parties, snake-charmers, and people of all ages, races, and cultures coming together to enjoy the beautiful weather (and Nathan\u2019s hotdogs from its original location).\nAt the New York Aquarium, we were mesmerized by tropical fish, sharks, and sting rays. I saw a sea lion show sitting beside two young children and together we delighted in the sea lions\u2019 tricks.\nShout out to the ever fantastic Open Culture, where I discovered the delightful Panoply project which focuses on animating ancient pottery.\nPanoply is run by Steve K. Simons and Sonya Nevin, combining Steve\u2019s animation skills with Sonya\u2019s expertise in ancient Greek culture.\nWe make animations from real ancient Greek vases. This site puts them together with a wealth of resources that give you reliable info on ancient culture and fresh ideas for teaching sessions on classical civilisation, art, and creative writing.\nYou can use these animations to spark all sorts of teaching and learning activities. They\u2019re particularly good for sessions on classical civilisation, art, and creative writing. They can be used with learners of all ages and levels, from primary through to higher education as well as community, home-school, and lifelong learning. If you don\u2019t have a group to teach, do the activities yourself or with your friends.\nFrom storyboarding, to writing, to film and animations studies, Panoply provides a wealth of resources to help you and your students engage with ancient civilizations and the craft of animation. Head over to their website to explore all their resources and blog which features discussions of vases and iconography as well as interviews with leading academics, and of course to watch their brilliant animations.\nWatch the interview below to hear Dr. Sonya Nevin talk about how the project started and how it has been used as a teaching aid in schools.\nAccording to one Western classical legend, the first paint was black and the first artist female. When Pliny the Elder was writing his Natural History\u2013a summary of everything available in the Roman Marketplace and quite a few other things besides\u2013he told a story of how the origin of art was found in epic love. After all, what better inspiration for art is there than passion? According to Pliny one of the first artists was a young woman in the town of Corinth in Greece who one evening was weepily saying good-bye to her lover before he set out on a long journey. Suddenly, between impassioned embraces, she noticed his shadow on the wall, cast by the light of a candle. So, spontaneously, she reached out for a piece of charcoal from the fire and filled in the pattern.\nI loved this little story and thought you might too.\nThe abstract masterpieces of such unlikely artists as Prehensile Tail Porcupines, goats, hissing cockroaches and vinegaroons (had to Google that one) are sure to infuse your Wednesday with a hefty dose of wonder and delight. This budding art collective is the result of an enrichment program from the ABQ BioPark Zoo. The therapeutic and enriching benefits of painting, it would seem, extend to animals. \u201cGetting them to use their brains and to figure things out keeps them happier and healthier,\u201d says zoo manager, Lynn Tupa.\nThe animals at the ABQ BioPark Zoo have learned to paint as an enrichment activity, purely for their own pleasure and mental stimulation. To ensure that painting remains enjoyable for the animals, the opportunity to paint is an occasional treat, not part of their daily routine.\nFrom primate Picassos to buggy Botticellis, our stable of talented animal artists has increased this year to provide an even greater variety of original masterpieces that will thrill collectors and animal enthusiasts alike. Choose from a number of genres and styles that include (but not limited to) elephants, gorillas, parrots, marsupials, alligators, insects and more!\nLately I\u2019ve been noticing the power and the artistry behind storytelling. As we\u2019ve blogged about before (here and here), stories can lead to empathy and social activism. Storytelling can also be a method of self-empowerment. Earlier this year I talked about how multimedia storytelling can be an amazing tool when put in the hands of our students. For example, Humans of New York is a current phenomenal short-form multimedia story project that both empowers the subjects and increases empathy and connectedness throughout the community.\nStorytelling is also an art, and nothing is worse than listening to a 30 minute story that seems to have no arc or theme. There are actual courses in storytelling that one can take in NYC. However, there are so many ways to tell a good story. While storytelling seems to be a human universal, each culture has its own deep-rooted traditions around the art form.\nA recent TED blog discusses how stories are told around the world. For example, hawaiian hula dancing is actually done to a song with a story. On my recent trip to Portugal, I heard traditional Fado music, which is a Portuguese musical storytelling form that began in the 1800s and often tells the story of a woman longing for a man out at sea.\nStorytelling, particularly the culturally-specific forms, is an amazing way to connect with students. Allowing students to express themselves in a variety of ways \u2014 rather than privileging text \u2014 is a prime opportunity to increase empowerment and cultural relevance in education.\nMonitoring the brain activity of hundreds of study subjects watching a video with a simple narrative, Zak found increases in the levels of the neurochemicals oxytocin and cortisol, which are associated with empathic responses. Most remarkable, however, was the discovery that this response also resulted in study subjects taking action, in this case through donating money they had just earned to a charitable cause related to the story they watched and even to fellow subjects. Zak\u2019s conclusion that there could be a universal story structure that functions to connect us to each other might not be surprising to storytellers, but seeing it supported by neuroscience is a tale worth repeating.\nHola rethinkers \u2026* Elsa here, back from my camino! Had a truly splendid time and made it all the way to Santiago. Walking 800 km has given me plenty of time to think (a really really good combination and ancient tradition this walking and thinking business). I\u2019m excited to share with you some of the insights and discoveries I made on my trip but as I\u2019ve only just got back and barely had time to digest my experience, I\u2019m going to write about something completely unrelated which happened this past weekend: I got to hang out with a six-year-old\u2014correction, a six-and-a-half-year-old\u2014 and I was struck by how much adults, especially those interested in challenging the status quo and developing their capacity for empathy, stand to learn from young children.\nI met Mathieu at his parents\u2019 house where I was having a long Sunday lunch. He sat at the table with us to eat a bit and then disappeared around the garden to play. When dessert was served, Mathieu came back for some ice cream, holding in his hand a Christmas catalogue. I asked him if he had started making his list for Santa and if he\u2019d show me what it was he wanted. We went over the catalogue together and he explained the various delights of each toy he had circled. I then asked him what was the one toy he most hoped Santa would bring him, to which he answered Lego\u2019s Hero Factory before disappearing to his room to bring back two specimens.\nI spent over an hour talking with Mathieu about his Lego Hero Factory toys and playing with him. I could hardly say which of us had the most fun. But the reason I wanted to write about my encounter with Mathieu, goes beyond wanting to brag about my awesome new tiny friend or my love of all things Lego. Having no children of my own, I rarely get the chance to hang out with the six-and-a-half-year-old crowd and that\u2019s a real shame. I\u2019m passionate about storytelling, empathy and the architecture of change and as my time with Mathieu showed me, we (the part of the population who no longer values half years in our age) have much to learn in all three of these interrelated domains from children.\nI think the fact that Mathieu corrected me each time I confused the cocoons and the jumpers or when I got carried away with battle sounds was critically important. He sensed my genuine interest in entering the Lego Hero Factory world and took it upon himself to guide me in. Each imaginary world operates according to a specific set of rules (so while vegetal cocoons attack robots in the Hero Factory world, machines do not speak or make battle calls) and it is these shared laws that keep the world bounded together and allow it to be a shared imaginary space. Creating these rules and then exploring the possibilities of the worlds created within them is what fiction writers, dreamers, and rethinkers \u2026* of all type do. It is no secret that soft skills are becoming increasingly important as the pace of change accelerates and the collective problems we face become increasingly wicked. We need people who can craft solid, inhabitable alternatives\u2013\u201cwhat ifs\u201d that offer better, more sustainable futures for more people. And that starts with storytelling and storytellers. We need to cultivate and amplify children\u2019s natural capacity for creating imaginary worlds and we need to learn from them how we ourselves might regain that wonderful and critical ability to ask \u201cwhat if?\u201d and run with it.\nNot only are children naturally adept storytellers, they are also able to grasp with ease the nuances of others\u2019 stories (I think the proper buzzword to describe this aptitude, these days, would be creative listeners). In many ways, each of us, carries and inhabits his or her own world. Our reality is constantly mediated by our perception; our understanding of ourselves and our relationship to others is shaped by a mix of past experiences, character traits, hopes, neuroses, tensions and dreams. In essence, empathy is about being able to experience what an exterior situation might feel like when viewed from the particular lens of another (an Other\u2019s internal world). Children do this extremely often when they are at play, seemingly without any effort. Just a few weeks ago, I was having a drink with a friend on a rather deserted village town square while two little girls played nearby. The girls were running around and jumping, taking turns yelling, \u201cnow water, now fire.\u201d Evidently, they were on an epic journey through the elements and shared a common imaginary space, worlds away from the physical environment, that had them running around panting with excitement. They were able to take turns designing the world and could seamlessly go from their own internal reality to that of their friend\u2019s, experiencing with equal ease and immediacy what was in their friend\u2019s mind\u2019s eye as what was inside their own.\nIt\u2019s interesting to note this link between play and empathy, how they seem to go hand in hand naturally. Perhaps it is because we try to stamp out our own playfulness as we age that we become more and more stuck within our own world and less able (or willing?) to enter into those of others. My advice? Go play with a tiny human.\nThis week I\u2019ve offered up my couch to a backpacker (actually, my air mattress), and it\u2019s been wonderful to re-experience NYC through a foreigner\u2019s eyes. An Australian I met in Portugal this summer asked if his buddy could crash at my place while visiting NYC, and I happily obliged. So last Tuesday night, Lulu arrived at my doorstep for his first experience of the USA.\nThis experience provided me with an opportunity to really think deeply about what I felt represented NYC, and what somebody should do if they only have one week here. We went to a lot of the main tourist attractions \u2014 Times Square, the Staten Island Ferry, Empire State Building, High Line, Central Park, WTC memorial \u2014 to name a few. This was actually fun and interesting because I grew up in New York and had never even been inside the Empire State Building before. I also got to explain the events of 9/11 as somebody who was here, to somebody who was halfway across the world.\nWe ate iconic and delicious food, including real New York pizza, bagels (everything with scallion cream cheese, tomato, and lox), burgers (chipotle, Jackson Hole, Umami), and Chipotle.\nI also let him see slices of my everyday life. We commuted up to Columbia and walked through the campus. We went to an arcade bar on the Lower East Side and drank PBR and played Miss Pac-man. We met up with my friends for nachos and craft beer. I got to experience my own day-to-day through the eyes of a person who up until this week had never been in a building with more than 6 stories. I re-appreciated the wonders of 1am Chinese food delivery from Seamless, 24/7 public transportation, amazingly tall sky scrapers and unbeatable waterfront sunsets. He heightened my sensitivity to things I had never noticed about my own life, like how it almost always smells like delicious food everywhere in Manhattan or how random strangers can shout super rude things at you (it barely registers to me).\nUltimately, I think the experience cultivated reflection about my own life and gratefulness for this dynamic, crazy place I call home. This speaks to the importance of changing perspectives, re-experiencing something with fresh eyes, and appreciation of what is all around us. Is there something in your own daily practice that could use a fresh perspective?\nIn celebration of International Coffee Day, I\u2019d like to talk about how we can rethink one of America\u2019s most coveted beverages. Many Americans love their daily morning cup of coffee. For me, it\u2019s all about the coffeehouse. It is a place where a buck entitles you to stay for as long as you like, and it\u2019s a cornerstone of communication and connection that holds something vital for our disconnected generation.\nThe coffeehouse has been a social hub of public discourse since its introduction into British society in the 1650s. The concept of the coffeehouse immediately resonated with the British bourgeoisie; by 1700 there were two thousand coffeehouses in London, and they were considered \u201cthe site for the public life of the eighteenth century middle class\u201d. Initially, these places took on many communal functions, characterized by civil discourse and intellectualism and home to the first modern newspapers and ballot box. Some go as far as to suggest coffeehouses are the birthplace of modern democracy. Coffeehouse culture quickly caught on in colonial America and became a defining aspect of American culture dating back to 1689.\nThe modern-day coffeehouse experience, mass-marketed by Starbucks, is one of relaxation, leisure, community, and enjoyment. It is a respite from the stresses of political and economic life. This redefined purpose of the coffeehouse is, best described by Ray Oldenburg in The Great Good Place, a cure to the more \u201cjangled and fragmented\u201d American lifestyle. Oldenburg\u2019s research concerned the specialness of commercial places that served as a location to unwind, relax, and talk. This social space was coined the \u201cthird place\u201d because it was neither home nor work, but rather a place where people simply felt comfortable. Oldenburg felt that this place would facilitate conversation, both between friends and strangers. This place has become a necessary solution to America\u2019s interactional ills. The disconnection in a world of technology and constant work can be offset by the civil engagement produced in the coffeehouse. The public nature of a coffeehouse interaction enables the physical and psychology intimacy of face to face conversation.\nFor the most part, NYC is full of strangers. It\u2019s one of those weird places where you can be surrounded by people but feel completely lonely. Coffeehouse culture here is mostly people conversing with their own friends or students and the self-employed staring intently at their Macbook screens.\nHowever, my favorite coffee shop, Birch, has something called the Ignition Initiative. The initiative presents a new twist on American coffee culture, and it\u2019s one that could really show promise for promoting human connections in a place where connection has traditionally thrived. As can be seen below, the shop has little placards with thought-provoking conversation starters. To participate, one simply places a placard on her table and waits for some one to approach.\nParticipants in the Ignition Initiative receive an extra free hour of WIFI (Birch provides 1 hour per customer), and it also resolves the issue of crowding, where one person has commandeered an entire table.\nI have to admit that I haven\u2019t yet tried this out yet, since I\u2019m usually there to do schoolwork, but I\u2019d love to give it a shot.

This being the case with this game, our hero Mr. Pratt has to deal with zombies, evil bats, spiders and more in his mansion, which have returned for revenge or something along those lines. Innovative ideas for each of the rooms that you explore, involving puzzles that will make you think before you act, and great suspenseful music all combine to set the stage for Mr. Pratt 2.\nWhen a legion of horrid monsters decide to invade the mansion of retired chemistry professor Mr. Pratt, he knows he must defeat them in the art of combat. He sets out to defeat the monsters that have invaded, and bring peace and tranquility to the world again, as well as the grand mansion that he managed to earn on a teacher's salary.\nThe controls are simple. Move with the left and right arrow keys, jump with the up arrow key and shoot with the space bar. To begin blasting away, you must to first collect a weapon in each room. The objective is to clear every room of all the monsters, and once you do so you can move onto the next one. Graphically the game looks nice overall. Most of the environments do look the same in terms of the colours used, but the general atmosphere of a dark and spooky mansion is shown very well. The challenges in each room are quite varied, and they get progressively harder as you proceed further into the mansion. Conserving ammo is especially important in some areas, while avoiding enemies to get your weapon can be important in other levels, too.\nThe music fits the mood of the game superbly. It is somewhat dark and suspenseful, and added to the whole gloominess while traveling through the mansion. The sound effects are decent as well; there is no cheesiness, and they fit the actions nicely.\nThe only problem with all the exploration is that it becomes repetitive after a while. Clearing each room will take some time and there are many to explore, but eventually doing the same thing, even with varied room mechanics, enemy placement, and platforms takes its toll. It also would have been nice if there were some more variety to the mansion itself. The dark colors are good and all but even some bright rooms would not have been bad.\nOverall, this was a pretty good game. If you're looking for a platform game to try out, give Mr. Pratt 2 a try and see for yourself.", "version": "v0"}

I had worked there as a newly qualified worker, and it had been instrumental in my professional formation. In response to the threat of closure an online petition was set up which attracted 1600 signatures in less them two weeks. The petition included an open comment box, a response was not required, but many chose to write publicly about the impact the service had. There were hundreds of comments. Many showed a deeply personal connection to a provision that had \u2018been a life line\u2019. The comments revealed an ongoing attachment to a service, and feelings of anger and an almost grief-like sadness, about its proposed closure.\nOn face value, the campaign was successful, and the closure was reversed. However, less than 18 months later, a further restructure made most staff redundant, announced the closure of the premises, and shifted the ethos and content of any remaining provision to such an extent, that it is hard to argue that anything remained. There was no recognition of this closure. For a while the website still promoted the service, with photos of staff and promises of help available (in the form of \u2018signposting\u2019). Its demise was obscured; hidden among austere local authority promises of \u2018delivering more for less\u2019 and \u2018working smarter\u2019. The \u2018death\u2019 of this service, was not acknowledged, it was \u2018ghosted\u2019 (Allan and Youdell, 2017; Bright and Pugh, 2019; Derrida, 1994). Only an illusion of its presence remained, offering tantalising glimpses of what used to be. This \u2018non-death\u2019 provided no opportunity to grieve, or to question.\nThe recent Youth and Policy article by Wayne Richards and Jo Lewis (2018) which reflected personally on closure of a Youth and Community Work course also resonated, highlighting that behind every headline are unseen personal stories of valued services, relationships and of the \u2018impact\u2019 they had on people\u2019s lives. Whilst the figures show one element of the decimation of youth service provision with estimated cuts approaching \u00a31 billion (Bulman, 2018), the loss of 3,500 youth worker jobs and around 140,000 places for young people (Smith, 2018), they fail to represent personal experiences.\nThe present piece is subjective and open to accusations of bias. However, it seeks to provide a narrative that acknowledges the personal impact of closures on services users, communities and staff. While recognising that the \u2018death\u2019 of a service does not equate to that of a person, this article usues this as an analogy and draws on the mechanisms we have developed as a society for understanding death to structure the analysis. So, in \u2018Loving Memory\u2019 I offer a post-mortem and inquest, examining the demise of the service, and conclude with an obituary and eulogy, remembering and memorialising this project.\nPost-mortems examine how, when and why someone died, and seek to gain a better understanding of the causes. If the death is found to be \u2018suspicious\u2019, \u2018sudden\u2019 or \u2018unnatural\u2019, an inquest is required. In many ways, the cause of the projects \u2018death\u2019 is obvious, resulting from \u2018insufficient resources\u2019. Stringent austerity measures, and the imposition of significant budget reductions on local authorities (IFS, 2016) resulted in reductions in service provision. Non-statutory services have been hardest hit (Local Government Association, 2014), as local authorities struggled to respond to reduced central government funding alongside increasing demand for statutory social care services. The disproportionate impact of austerity measures on vulnerable groups has been highlighted and questions are being raised as to whether this was a \u2018political choice\u2019 rather than a financial necessity (Alston, UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty in Butler, 2018).\nAt this point I must acknowledge that the post-mortem analogy struggles. In our society, selecting an individual to die, because of insufficient resources is both immoral and illegal. We only engage with these debates in philosophical terms, testing ethical theories, debating whether \u2018survival of the fittest\u2019, noble sacrifice or pure luck provides the best justification. However, in these austere times, decisions between one provision and another means that some, rather than others, are left metaphorically, and sometimes literally, \u2018out in the cold\u2019 (Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, 2018). In this context, the demise of the project, which, prior to the removal of funding, was \u2018in good health\u2019, could be argued to be both \u2018sudden\u2019 and \u2018unnatural\u2019. The identification of this particular project for the removal of funding, despite clear local support requires further investigation.\nAn inquest is conducted in a Coroner\u2019s Court; it is not a trial. It seeks to establish how, when, and where the death occurred, not who was responsible. The Coroner\u2019s jurisdiction is inquisitorial rather than accusatory. I will attempt to adopt the same process here, avoiding accusations of blame, rather trying to learn lessons. At the end of the process \u2018a verdict\u2019 is recorded, the possible outcomes that will be explored here are: natural causes; misadventure; neglect and unlawful killing.\nA verdict of natural causes seems unlikely in this case. There are youth projects, which are born, run their course, and then cease, as population and other provision shifts; young people stop attending, and no longer desire or require what is on offer. Sunday schools and Boys and Girls club provision both declined as demand dwindled (Jeffs, Coburn, Scott-McKinley and Drowley, 2019). This was not true in this case. Prior to budget cuts, and even as they began, Project 129 was in good health. It could not even be accused of failing to be able to provide evidence of this, an accusation too often levelled at youth work projects (Jeffs, 2015). Annual reports (Project 129, 2010/11 ) evidenced national interest in the provision \u2013 following a visit, the Permanent Secretary for the DCSF (Department for Children, Schools and Families) commented, \u2018it was clear to me that you are doing excellent work\u2019. Increasing numbers of young people were accessing the service, even as opening hours began to reduce. Qualitative and quantitative approaches to evaluation were employed: young people accessing the service for mental health support were more likely to turn up to the Project than to equivalent CAMHS provision; \u2018distance travelled\u2019 by those accessing the service on a range of issues had been plotted and measured. There were cost breakdowns as well as testimonials from service users about the difference support from the project had made. The fatal, inbuilt, weakness was that it was funded solely from local authority resources. As a statutory provision it was prevented from accessing charitable money. This meant there was no way to spread the risk from the withdrawal of funding. It also meant that there was no external oversight, no board of trustees, external to local authority decision-making structures, who might speak up on its behalf. While the weakness was internal, the same as an allergy or heart condition, the trigger was external. The \u2018death\u2019 resulted from actions selected, and taken outside of the projects control. These actions were taken knowing the consequences that would result.\nIn Coroner\u2019s terms, a record of misadventure indicates that a death occurred while a legal act was being undertaken without negligence or intention to do harm; had the project taken actions which contributed to the cause? Perhaps the recent collapse of Vinspired could be viewed in these terms (Weakley, 2018). In seeking to adapt to new austere environments, they took risks in delivering contracts, attempting to stretch these to enable broader delivery of a wider vision, which left them overexposed. However, the extent to which this was a choice is debateable, as without taking these risks the future survival was already threatened. Misadventure implies some form of unfortunate incident or mishap; this does not seem to fit this picture, perhaps viewing this as a desperate survival strategy would be more appropriate. However, Project 129 was not given the opportunity to even attempt to take the risk that Vinspired took. While some staff expressed an interest in exploring options around forming a co-operative, setting up as a separate charity or establishing the project as a Community Interest Company or Social Enterprise, there was no significant or strategic support available to pursue this. Staff were required to explore these options on their own, alongside maintaining service delivery and re-applying for jobs. Unsurprisingly, after 2 years of fighting closure plans they ran out of the energy, and optimism, required to try to disengage the project from a local authority that was unwilling to let it go, but equally unable/unwilling to provide it with the resources necessary to continue. Most decided to take \u2018voluntary\u2019 redundancy, unwilling to partake in the ghosting of the service. They refused to support the illusion that, despite the removal of the building, youth work values and most of the staff, provision would continue. They had lost faith that the local authority believed they had any responsibility to provide holistic support for young people.\nPerhaps a verdict that negligence contributed to the death of the service fits best. The project ended because of a failure to meet its basic needs. Reductions in council funding, allied with the non-statutory nature of youth provision, meant it was entirely lawful for the funding to be reduced and removed. The project was vulnerable, entirely reliant on its local authority parent, who decided that there were not sufficient resources to allow it to continue. However, neglect implies a lack of action, whereas, steps were taken to weaken the project following the first successful challenge to the closure. Evaluation was standardised and administrative support was removed, so the project was less able to make a case that it was \u2018delivering\u2019. Despite the many valid critiques of neoliberal approaches to monitoring and evaluation (Bright, 2015; de St Croix, 2018) this was an extremely effective approach; whereas previously, the project could \u2018prove\u2019 the number of young people they had helped, and in what ways, as targets and monitoring were \u2018aligned and streamlined\u2019 they lost the ability to show the impact they had. As services merged, streamlined efficient management became more generic, less aware of the nuances of Project 129 (or youth work more generally), and much less capable of supporting staff in exploring any alternative delivery options. Senior managers concerned with avoiding political issues associated with project closure, learnt lessons from their first attempt, and ensured the details of any restructured provision remained vague. The required consultation about the proposed new structure asked questions about a deliberately opaque model. It is not possible to campaign against a closure when it is hidden in plain sight.\nHowever, another possible verdict could be unlawful killing. In this case, this would mean that a criminal offence of corporate manslaughter had occurred. This could only be recorded if the way in which the local authority\u2019s activities were managed or organised caused the death of the service and amounted \u2018to a gross breach of a relevant duty of care owed to the deceased\u2019 (Thornton, 2016: 3). Again, the analogy struggles at this point, because the value of a project is not equivalent to the value of a human life either in legal or moral terms. However, given the approach of the local authority, it could be argued that they knowingly undertook actions that caused the death, actively prevented actions that may have saved it, and that, as its sole funder, had indeed breached its duty of care. However, given the stark choices faced by local authorities under stringent austerity cuts, they too may have a case for directing the responsibility for these decisions to national government.\nSchedule 5 of The Coroners (Investigations) Regulations (2013) requires Coroners to make recommendations if they feel that that a death could have been prevented if different actions had been taken. Having considered the circumstances of the death of this project, what follows falls short of being recommendations, but are questions that beg answers.\nGiven provision\u2019s vulnerability rested largely on its location within the local authority, I question the calls for a re-establishment of local authority responsibility for, and provision of, youth facilities. While I have no doubt that government should have a responsibility to resource provision for young people, I am tentative about recommending a return to entrusting this solely to local authority provision. Had the project had a wider funding base, and independent oversight, its chances of survival could have greatly increased. It would not have been solely at the mercy of local politicians (and national austerity policy), and could have exerted greater control over its fate.\nThe reliance on local democratic structures to defend youth provision failed, and while a statutory requirement for provision could have resisted some of the reductions, the form of practice could still be dictated. Consequently, I am deeply sceptical about calls for renewed commitment from government for statutory provision, and the warm reception given by the sector to such promises (NYA, 2018). The warnings of those who were sceptical of the creation of the statutory youth service in the 1930\u2019s echo down the years (Davies, 1999). Before we eagerly seek the funding (and associated conditions) from national or local government we need to consider the lessons that can be learned from the recent decimation of services, so that any future provision is better equipped to survive.\nObituaries \u2018actively shape \u201chow societies remember\u201d\u2019 (Fowler, 2005: 148). They raise awareness of a death so that the wider community can send condolences. Writing an obituary in these circumstances announces the \u2019death\u2019 of the service, which had previously been obscured, and acknowledges this publicly. The publication of an obituary represents collective memory; whereas the uncommented passing of Project 129 reinforces \u2018organised forgetting\u2019 (Fowler, 2004: 149). Obituaries tend to be fact based, and have developed from death notices that were issued by undertakers. Overtime they have become fuller, and usually published by a relative. An opinionative obituary, which offers an emotive and intimate account of the deceased, is used to comfort those that remain, presenting a favourable picture which highlights the social status of the deceased (Crespo-Fern\u00e1ndez, 2007).\nEulogies tend to be speeches, and are less formal and factual, aiming to capture an individual\u2019s essence. Van Den Scott, Forstie, and Balasubramanian (2015) contended that \u2018eulogy work\u2019 enables people to deal with the loss, manage emotions and convey the emotional energy that had been contained within the experience of both the life and death. Writing this eulogy acknowledges the loss, both to me personally, and to others involved as staff or young people, and seeks to capture the emotional energy that the project staff and young people experienced and the emotional work that was, in many ways the main focus of the project (Hochschild, 2003). While this piece may be subjective, it fulfils a social function, serving to provide recognition the of the value of the \u2018life\u2019 of the project.\nThe project began its life on a very part-time basis around 1985, operating from underneath a church, offering information, advice and support to young people 16-25. It relocated to a dilapidated youth building and then moved again in the mid 1990\u2019s to a city centre shop front location. The project supported the development of a young person\u2019s life handbook, which was written by staff, offering information and signposting on a range of topics. Still operating on a part-time basis, and staffed by part-time youth workers, investment in the service began to grow as New Labour came to power. The staff team and opening hours were extended (although it remained part-time), and numbers of young people accessing the service increased. The project provided information and support on a wide range of issues, mental health, (including counselling provision), sexual health, housing, rights, benefits, alcohol and drugs, homelessness and employment. Work to promote equality was also important, with the city LGB youth group (as it was known then) and Girls work also running from the project. The staff were also involved in campaigning and advocacy work around these issues. The range of services offered continued to expand, as pregnancy and sexual health testing were introduced, the published life handbook moved online, and advocacy group of young people with experience of accessing mental health services was established. The shop front began to struggle to meet increasing demand, additional spaces were required so young people could speak confidentially, counselling provision could be expanded and staff did not have to conduct confidential phone conversations from the bathroom.\nThis corresponded with the establishment of the Connexions service. While the project did not seek to target its work at young people who were \u2018NEET\u2019 (Not in Education, Employment or Training), many of the young people using the service found themselves in this position. Combining resources enabled the project to move to a larger building in the mid 2000\u2019s, and to further extend opening hours, operating on a nearly full-time five days a week basis, with occasional weekend opening for specific projects. Tensions between the targeted nature of Connexions and the holistic approach of the project were acknowledged, and carefully managed. The 2008 recession and the election of the coalition government in 2010 began to impact on resourcing for local authorities, and consequently on resources available for youth provision. A series of restructures, which sought to address the reduction in funding began. Initially the project survived, although staffing was reduced. The size and cost of a city centre building now became a disadvantage, significant staff numbers were required to open safely. The first proposal in 2015 to close the building and \u2018relocate\u2019 the service was successfully challenged. However, a further restructure in 2016 effectively ended the provision, and by 2017, the building was empty. The counselling service was reduced, relocated to an adult facility, and has now be contracted out. Other elements were notionally offered through the council\u2019s overall \u2018customer service centre\u2019. Although the closure of the service was never acknowledged, it had ended.\nI worked here as my first proper job out of university. I learnt so much there. I learnt from the staff, from working as team. And I learnt from the manager, who created an open reflective environment. I learnt about quality assurance that encompassed tick box paper exercises, but located these within a much broader culture that actively, and sometimes painfully, sought improvement. I learnt about the importance of structures and processes alongside people to ensure good practice. I learnt about supportive supervision. I learnt about the process of considering and applying youth work values in a local authority environment, through ongoing discussions, debates and questions and through a willingness to fight and be obstinate. I learnt about the importance of having a clear rationale for any approach, and evidence to support this, to help you fight your ground and defend your corner. I learnt about the importance of knowing systems and not being afraid to take on management, and local politicians, if needed, and about how vital solidarity was if you do this. I learnt about the importance of ethical reflection, and of keeping this in mind when considering how and why you are working with young people in particular ways. I learnt about the tricky balance between supporting people with individual problems, but not losing sight of the systemic causes of these, and seeking to challenge these at a broader level, with (and sometimes for) young people.\nI learnt how important it is to understand things from others\u2019 perspectives; that listening is essential; and that knowing isn\u2019t the same as understanding. I learnt from the young people. I learnt that \u2018being with\u2019 someone has a value in itself; and that time is important. I learnt that young people are not \u2018issues\u2019 or \u2018problems\u2019 and that just because forms have boxes, this is not a good reason to force people to be the same. For me, a holistic response is the only human response I can offer. I learnt that young people can have an incredible capacity to survive, and that providing someone with the space to regroup is a privilege. I learnt that sometimes it\u2019s very hard to make difference, that sometimes it feels you can\u2019t win, and that sometimes you don\u2019t. I learnt that sometimes a small thing can have significance you don\u2019t recognise at the time. I learnt that hope is vital to working with young people, no matter how big the obstacle. I also learnt about the things that can (and cannot) be laminated!\nThere can be a tendency to see a rosy picture when looking back. But I also learnt about poor staff relations, inadequate resources, management conflicts and failings, and I learnt from the experience of young people we didn\u2019t manage to help.\nI left there nearly 20 years ago, but it still forms my professional approach. A combination of the service\u2019s ethos, the approach of staff and the challenges faced by young people shape who I am today. I can see the difference it made to me. I saw the difference it made to young people then, and, occasionally, I get glimpses of the ongoing impact it has on lives.\nI see the gaps it leaves and worry about those young people who will find that \u2018signposting\u2019 is not enough. I wonder who will be there to fill those gaps, who will find the time to listen and sit alongside them and see the world from their point of view, to join the dots up \u2026not to \u2018process me, but to help me, the person that is uniquely, personally me.\u2019 (The Heard, 2006).\nI have no doubt that the approach and ethos are valuable, and will re-emerge. For now though, I want to highlight the gap that has been left. I want my sadness and my anger to be known. That something that was valuable, and valued, in many measurable, and immeasurable ways, was discarded so easily. And that its passing was hidden.\n The research was approved by the York St John ethics committee and protected the anonymity of participants. The quotes are verbatim.\n The project\u2019s name has been changed. Some staff involved are still working for the local authority. Any association with the campaign to challenge the closure of the service was seen to potentially place them in breach of contract, and so identification may still place them at risk.\nThanks to Graham Bright for comments on early drafts.\nAllan, J. and Youdell, D.

Afterwards, we're meeting up with my parents (which I'm looking forward to because it's been a while since we've actually vacationed as a family somewhere that wasn't called Home).\nI'm a bit antsy about leaving the shop unmanned like the worrywart I am, but this is one of the things I'm working on. Letting go. If I had the chance, I'd just work and work. I did that as a doctor (oh, you so wouldn't have approved of my lifestyle & diet back then - on really bad days, it would be a meal a day, sometimes from the vending machine) and I still find myself slipping into old habits as an artist. I get so engrossed that I forget to eat or drink. Yes, a bit extreme, but I put it down to habits? Like I said, I'm quite bad at letting things go. They have to be done. As soon as possible. As best as possible. And funny enough, the day just disappears and I'm faced with trying to figure out what to cook for dinner again. I've forgotten that a few times before and had to deal with a very grumpy husband... oops!\nSo this vacation. It's more than just a vacation. It's a test and a challenge in letting go. Allowing myself to accept that the world will still be here when I get back, and that it's ok to send out any orders then. But I still feel bad. So you all get a discount on any orders placed while I'm gone. To make me feel a bit less guilty about ditching you guys :) Enjoy, and see you when we're back!\nEven though these have been around for a while now, my latest obsession has moved onto pom poms. I loved making them out of the cardboard holders, a technique I learnt off Mr Printables. Imagine my delight when I realized there were \"real\" pom pom makers.. ones that allowed you to make them in different sizes and shapes!! But being a bit of a tightwad (although I'd like to think the reason was more sentimental than monetary..), I liked my original cardboard pom pom maker better.\nWell, how did you go? If you make any pompoms and want to show them off online, don't forget to tag them with #sharethemess or tag us directly with @sharethemess - I'd love to see your creations!!\nP.S. As a little tip, stretchy, fluffy yarn works best to make large, fluffy pom poms. I tried to use some of our fuzzy twine, but it wasn't puffy and was too stiff. As you can see from the picture below (left-hand side), the resulting pom pom is looking quite sad and very un-pom pom like compared to the one on the right! The forks on the \"normal\" pom pom are there to show you that there is that central piece running through down the middle in both pom poms.\nAfter a huge delay, here's the How.Do fingerprint bunny tutorial thatI showed a screenshot of before... just in time for Easter!!\nA few people have mentioned that they'll be making bunny tags for their Easter gifts, and even birthday gifts and I'm so excited just thinking about bunnies galore :) So much so, I decided to add to the bunny mayhem with a free bunny & egg printable!\nI must admit, T-shirt designing is a whole new territory for me. I'm much more comfortable with cards, stickers and other stationery so this is all an exciting learning experience!\nClothing design might come easy for some of you, but for me, it involved trying to imagine what designs and colors I would wear and researching what's popular in T-shirt designs online and offline. Trying to find a running theme amongst the other entries at Ohh Deer wasn't very fruitful. There were bold, simple cartoons sprinkled among fine, detailed illustrations and everything in between! So with all of that, I started thinking of what I'd like my 3 entries to be like.\nSo many things to think about, really. Designs can't be too small or fine, colors can't be too bland or they'll just blend into the T-shirt.. gotta also imagine what the design would look like enlarged across someone's chest. I had a zillion ideas and had a lot of trouble narrowing them down to just the 3 designs I was allowed.\nWhat you see above are the end results. I wanted to keep away from the popular, but extremely common, themes of floral borders, woodland animals and typography quotes. I kind of succeeded, but weakened at the florals.. I had too much fun painting blossoms for a recent project!\nAs much as I'd love and appreciate you clicking on my floral heart, Aussie animal friends or zen CurlieQ to boost my score for the competition, I would rather feedback and comments about the designs themselves if you'd care to share your thoughts? Trying to plan my ideas for this competition has been a hugely enjoyable learning process and I'd like to think that somewhere down the future of Gloriousmess!, there will be clothing and other wearables I can offer you!\nP.S. If you're really keen on any of the designs, you can buy them off the above links from the ohhdeer.com site. These will be printed on demand, and will only be available until April 28th as part of the design competition. I've got nothing to do with it all (except to produce and upload the designs) and won't be earning a single penny off your purchases from Ohh Deer.\nIf any of you would like to purchase and the shipping is putting you off, I'd be happy to lodge a huge order to lump everyone's orders together and then mail them out to you from here. Just let me know the items you want by this Weds, April 16th so I can place the group order and send out your invoices. If there's enough people interested, I'll be placing the group order on Friday, April 18th, assuming everyone's paid their invoices by then!\nEach week, Missy Messy picks an Etsy treasury (collections of items individual users pick... it's like going window-shopping) to showcase, and whips up a rhyme inspired by the treasury theme. This week's treasury is \"Smoke and Sunshine\" by Kelly from Colourscape Studios. Enjoy!\nP.S. You might have noticed that there is something slightly different with this week's format. It's because the usual Treasury tools aren't able to grab code as usual from Etsy treasuries recently. They're guessing it might be because of coding changes on the Etsy website, but nobody's quite sure. It's one huge screenshot instead of individual clickable links. You'll be taken to the original treasury on Etsy instead of the actual listing when you click on the picture now. There is also a smaller version from CraftCult using a script, but it's not running for me. Wonder if it is for you? You'll see the same treasury twice if it is (but the smaller treasury's individual items will be clickable. If you have any better workarounds, please let me know!\nEach week, Missy Messy picks an Etsy treasury (collections of items individual users pick... it's like going window-shopping) to showcase, and whips up a rhyme inspired by the treasury theme.

Such as when she takes things I say as a put down, or when I think I\u2019ve said something the right way, but instead the words come flying back at me. So I\u2019ve learned to keep the peace by walking around on eggshells, trying to pick that special time to speak, always being afraid to rock the boat, or of offending her.\nLast edition, I wrote about how one of our most important choices is how we present or define ourselves to other people. We all have our own attitudes, beliefs, thoughts, roles and demeanors that we choose when interacting with others. These choices define how the world, in turn, reacts to us because thoughts are actually Things, made of Consciousness or Awareness. I also mentioned that the healing had to start in my home, with my inner self.\nWhat I want to say is that if I always project the attitude of being afraid, of being uneasy, always being too nice, too easy, too agreeable just to keep the peace, I\u2019m really not doing either party any justice at all. It seems that I\u2019ve only transferred all the emotional scars from my childhood, without realizing it, to raising my children.\nWith all the inner changes that I\u2019ve tried to accomplish in the past couple of years, I\u2019ve come to realize that it\u2019s a never-ending learning process and it may take a lifetime. Just when it seems I have things under control or what I think of as control, I\u2019m reminded there is still a lot of room for healing and change within myself. I\u2019m amazed at how my outer world changes and will continue to change as long as my inner world does.\nVisiting my daughter this past week was quite pleasant, even though in my mind we\u2019re constantly struggling to keep a balance between us. I found this time it wasn\u2019t that hard for me. This time, the little comments that would normally make me feel out of place or uneasy seemed not to be present. I was calm inside, I could let things go without feeling the fear of upsetting anyone. I could actually laugh things off and make light of everything. It was quite a good feeling. It\u2019s taken a long time for me to be able to react this way and I\u2019m sure there will be times when I do slip back into the old ways, but they are getting a little less each time.\nWe spent time chatting without the usual attitudes of \"I know better than you,\u201d or \"Don\u2019t tell me what to do.\u201d We watched movies together and shared belly laughs. I was included in a group event with some of her closest friends and not made to feel that I was in the way or intruding. When my daughter had to run to the store she asked if I would like to come too. There was just a whole different attitude and feeling that I was experiencing with her. She actually hugged me four or five times with a genuine hug! Not that cold kind where it can\u2019t be over fast enough. What a feeling! Being loved and accepted.\nI think back on past times and wonder how much had been my fault that things had become so cold. Was it my fearful attitude and how I presented myself that caused a lot of the emotional problems that I was feeling? Did I project this onto my family? It would seem to me that since I\u2019ve come to terms with my parents and made the shift to being accepted and loved by them, that there\u2019s been a shift in my relationship with my daughter and her family. I now realize when I shift inner thoughts about myself, whether they be good or bad, they\u2019re always reflected back to me.\nThis entry was posted on Friday, July 4th, 2008 at 2:48 pm\tand is filed under PONDERING.

It is a strong oxidizing agent with acrid and pungent odor. Nitric acid is mainly used to add nitrogen into other compounds and is naturally made by reacting rain water with nitrogen oxides present in air. It is highly toxic and hence must be handled carefully by wearing gloves, masks, and protective glasses. Nitric acid produces flammable hydrogen gas when it comes in contact with metals.\nRising demand for concentrated nitric acid from several end-use industries such as automotive and agrochemicals among others is fueling growth of concentrated nitric acid market. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), around 70% of nitric acid is used for the production of ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), which finds wide application in fertilizers. Furthermore, rising demand for nylon 6-6, as a replacement for metals in the automotive industry is fueling growth of concentrated nitric acid market.\nHowever, stringent government regulations and environmental concerns are major restraining factors hindering growth of concentrated nitric acid market. According to the United States Government Publishing office (GPO), under title 49 CFR 173.158, nitric acid (more than 40% of concentration) cannot be packed with any other material and should not contain impurities such as hydrochloric (HCl) or sulfuric acid (H2SO4) acid while transported by highway or by rail.\nOn the basis of end-use industries, the agrochemicals sector is expected to dominate the concentrated nitric acid market over the forecast period. Rising global population has led to an increasing demand for food grains. Therefore, the demand for agrochemicals has increased significantly in order to increase the yield of farming, which in turn will increase demand for concentrated nitric acid. According to the India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF), the agrochemical sector in India is expected to grow at 7.5% annually with a growing domestic demand of 6.5% per annum, to reach US$ 6.3 billion by 2020.\nEurope dominated the global concentrated nitric acid market in 2016. Europe has the highest consumption for concentrated nitric acid, owing to its requirement in fertilizer industries for the synthesis of ammonium nitrate and calcium ammonium nitrate. According to Coherent Market Insights, the annual production of nitric acid was valued at 55 million tons. Furthermore, around 96% of the nitric acid is used for the production of calcium ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrate, and a relatively small amount is used for the production of explosives. However, some of the European economies such as Germany and Ireland banned ammonium nitrate, mandating that it should be combined with calcium carbonate, which is restraining growth of the concentrated nitric acid market at present.\nAsia pacific is the fastest growing market region for concentrated nitric acid with China being the frontrunner for this market. The demand for concentrated HNO3 is rising due to its increasing applications in fertilizers, textiles, vehicles, and explosives among others. Furthermore, the burgeoning growth of automotive industry in Asia Pacific has led to a robust demand for concentrated nitric acid. According to the India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF), automobiles in India was valued at US$ 74 billion in 2015 and is estimated to reach up to US$ 260 billion to US$ 300 billion by 2026.\nNorth America is expected to show a steady growth in concentrated nitric acid market over the forecast period. Increasing demand for Ammonium Nitrate and Fuel Oil (ANFO), which acts as oxidizing agent and fuel absorbent in manufacturing of civil explosives is another major driver for high demand for concentrated nitric acid in the region. According to the United States Geographical Survey, in North America, mixtures of ANFO are used in around 80% of the explosives.\nSeveral companies are focused towards adopting various organic and inorganic growth strategies such as mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and partnerships, and product or technological innovations to retain position in the concentrated nitric acid market. For instance, in January 2016, KBR Inc. acquired Plinke GmbH, Weatherly Inc, and Chematur Ecoplanning Oy to provide fertilizer complex solutions that will help in improving nitric acid plant performance and expanding their presence outside North America. Furthermore, Weatherly Inc., a subsidiary of KBR Inc. launched dual pressure nitric acid technology in September 2016, which allowed large scale production of nitric acid.\nSome of the leading players operating in the global concentrated nitric acid market include Nutrien Ltd., BASF S.E., CF Industries Holdings, Inc., Bayer A.G., LSB Industries Inc., Shandong Fengyuan Chemical Stock Co.,Ltd., DowDuPont Inc., Ube Industries, and Yara International.", "version": "v0"}

I set the display to indicate the power output and started gradually increasing load to the bicycle until I reached my comfort limit. At that point I was able to steadilly output around 150 W. By steadilly, I mean for at least 1/2 hour. The more you cycle, the fitter you'll get and that limit will increase up to a certain point. You will most likely do better with a real bicycle as the riding position, saddle and handlebars will give you a better fit.\nA more accurate approach would be to try the hardest steep hill that we can comfortably climb (we need to know the slope of the hill that can be obtained in websites with a map that also show the elevation, like www.mapmyride.com ) and record the speed (the climb should be done at a constant speed).\nThe following article on the Copenhagen Cycle Chic blog has some good cycling tips, unfortunatelly the point 5 (gears) can be misleading since it tries to apply flat city arguments to hilly cities. And even though I agree that the bicycle's weight is not signifficant up to a certain point, it is not totally irrelevant either. The whole weight (bike+cargo+cyclist) will be something to consider when chosing the gearing range of a bicycle, except when that bicycle is to be used only in flat areas.\nTo overcome some steep hills when this type of infrastructure is not present, one can either walk the bike up the hill or have a lowest gear that is low enough to make it within the rider's available power. It's not enough to say that \"if 3 speeds don't make it get 5 speeds\". You could even have 18 speeds and still not be able to climb that hill. In this case what matters is how low is your lowest speed and how much weight will you have to carry uphill.\nThis weight will be the total weight of the set bicycle+rider+cargo, so, lets see what happens if we have a 70 Kg person riding a 13 Kg bicycle carrying 7 Kg of cargo (total weight 90 Kg) and we add 5 Kgs to the bicycle's weight.\nThese 5 Kilos can mean 1 set of fenders, chainguard, mudflaps, rack, basket, saddlebag and set of tools which would turn an inadequate commuting bicycle into something much more practical.\na difference of 2 Watts which is not even noticeable by the rider. Also, the power needed to carry the load is small to begin with because it's an almost flat surface.\nAs you can see on the graph above, even if the total weight raises to 160 Kg the power needed to carry it up the 1% slope will be under 50 Watts. In these conditions anybody can ride even a fully loaded cargo bike.\nthe 12 Watts difference could barelly be noticed by the rider, and would it be worth saving weight on a set of accessories that make all the difference when using the bicycle for transportation purposes?\nI still don't think so. But what we see is that the steeper the hill, the bigger the difference even a small 5 Kg load will make, because now, the necessary amount of power to carry the load up the hill is aproaching the power we can steadilly output.\n1-Lowering the gear ratio: replacing the rear sprocket by a bigger one or the chainring by a smaller one.\nby using this sheet, you will see that reducing the cadence will translate in a decrease in the necessary amount of power to go up the slope. This happens because you're lowering your speed and Power = Force x Speed. However, the force you will have to apply to the pedals (Avge. crank force) will be the same and if this force goes beyond your comfort level, reducing the cadence will make it even more painfull on your knees. In my case, I feel comfortable pushing the pedals with a force up to 20% of my weight because I never get up from the saddle to push the pedals.\nIf you usually stand to push the pedals, then maybe you can use your whole weight for a while. If it's a long climb you will need to do something to the gear ratio.\nThe following graph shows that for an 80 Kg set at a cadence of 60 rpm with 39 gear inches most people would be able to climb hills up to a 6% slope (under 150 Watts of power required).", "version": "v0"}

For all that, the switch from one world to another hasn't gone without its share of difficulties as a result of minor preparation issues and the time required for the solo sailors to get into the swing of things.\nEnemy number one for some at the moment is sea sickness. At this morning's audio session, certain sailors admitted feeling a little under the weather, including Julien Bozzolo (Mariolle.fr), Francois Denis (So-Boat.com) and Arnaud Etchandy (Ipar Hego). They're surely not alone in this, but at the front of the fleet the leaders are already being careful not to disclose any signs of weakness as tradition dictates.\nThe first hours of racing can also have their share of nasty surprises. Julien Hereu (Poema Insurance) has been trying to resolve an issue with his generator, whilst Marc Miro (Alfin) has reported difficulties getting his AIS to work. Meantime, Irish skipper Thomas Dolan (Offshoresailing.fr) has had to retrace his steps after realising that he'd failed to respect the course marks at the coastal course gate. Italian Matteo Rusticali (Spot), who set sail at the helm of the oldest boat in the race, built for the Mini-Transat 1991, has sadly dismasted and was originally making for La Rochelle under jury rig. Given his course, it would seem that he's now opted instead for the mouth of the Gironde estuary to make landfall.\nTeam Sun Hung Kai / Scallywag have announced three new crew members for the 2017-18 edition of the Volvo Ocean Race, including Dutch Olympic medallist, Annemieke Bes.\nSkipper David Witt, who is leading Hong Kong's first ever entry in the Volvo Ocean Race, has announced three new additions to his crew - Tom Clout (AUS), Antonio Fontes (POR) and Dutch Olympic Silver medallist, Annemieke Bes (NED).\nUntil today, Team Sun Hung Kai / Scallywag was the only team, out of the seven competitors, to not have considered female sailors. The announcement of Bes now means every Volvo Ocean Race team has female sailors fully integrated into their crew line up.\nBes was, until recently, part of team AkzoNobel, the Dutch entry in the race skippered by Simeon Tienpont, but recently made the switch to Witt's team.\nThe boats are currently undergoing a final maintenance period in Lisbon ahead of sailing to Alicante for the start of the race on 22 October 2017.\n*Other crew configurations include 10 sailors if the team consists of an even male/female split. An all-female team may race with 11 crew.\nThe Dutch yacht builder Royal Huisman supports Team Brunel in the Volvo Ocean Race 2017-18 through their expertise and know-how. Last week there was a team from Royal Huisman in Lisbon to help the shorecrew in and around the Volvo Ocean Race Boatyard with last big pre-race maintenance.\nSkipper Bekking is very excited about the support from the Dutch yacht builder. Bekking: \"The expertise and know-how from Royal Huisman are undisputed. On top of that they have a glorious history in this race as the builder of two winning boats: Flyer and Flyer II. With their yachts Dutchman Conny van Rietschoten won the Whitbread Round the World Race, the predecessor of the Volvo Ocean Race, in the late 70's, early '80's.\nTeam Director Gideon Messink: \" Royal Huisman is, as a partner from the Sailing Holland Sailors Club directly connected to Team Brunel. Where we can benefit from their knowledge and skills, they get unique opportunities from the Volvo Ocean Race. They can bring in guests and relations in the impressive world of the Race and have a very exclusive view behind the scenes.

The Championship will conclude on Saturday, October 7 with an awards ceremony at Sail Newport.\nAs part of the celebrations for the 60th anniversary of the OK Dinghy, a new book is being published. Under the working title, project 60, this will be the story of the OK through personal anecdotes and stories.\nWhile many sailors and friends have sent in stories for the book, and there are a lot of really good ones, we still need lots more to complete the project. Many people have also promised materials and not yet delivered.\nThe goal remains to try and get this book published before Christmas so you can all have one in your stocking, but for that to happen a lot of stories need to arrive in the next month.\nSustainable development is traditionally defined as something that meets the needs of the present without compromising the needs of the future. Using innovative thinking to advance sustainable practices is core to The Schmidt Family Foundation's 11th Hour Racing programme. One area in which the programme is now involved is the delicate but still largely overlooked issue of the disposal of obsolete leisure craft.\nSpace is a precious commodity at the Rhode Island State central landfill: in 2038 the 1,040-acre site will stop accepting new material. The looming deadline has made one waste problem more complex: what to do with old fibreglass hulls?\nThe steady accumulation of end-of-life vessels in coastal communities across the United States and Europe has sparked discussion around a variety of intertwined environmental and economic issues. Currently, the most common destination for these ageing craft is the landfill or worse: abandoned in backyards, boatyards or local waterways. Landfill managers typically use a simple mechanical process to cut and crush the glassfibre mat, polyester resins and ancillary material, subsequently compressing and burying remains within the greater mixture of municipal solid waste.\nBased on the established estimates of national end-of-life vessel populations, these traditional processes are already burying millions of metric tons of fibreglass around the world each year. This practice is a mistreatment of usable composite material and is environmentally perilous waste management.\nCascais laid on an action-packed day for the conclusion of the 2017 RC44 Championship's penultimate event, the RC44 Cascais Cup. At the beginning of it, Igor Lah's Team CEEREF held a slender lead, but lost it to Charisma. By the start of the third and final race Alexander Novoselov's Katusha was leading by two points. Despite Team CEEREF sailing an immaculate final race, a second placed finish for Katusha enabled the Russian team to win the RC44 Cascais Cup by just one point.\nWhile the wind started off at 10-14 knots, again from the unusual northerly, offshore direction, by the first run it was already up to 20 knots and remained firmly in the 20-25 knot range for the remainder of today's three races. In this RC44s could hit speeds of 20+ knots during downwind surf-fests.\nKatusha's 3-1-2 winning scoreline today was the best any of the boats posted this week. Ed Baird was standing in for Andy Horton on tactics and paid tribute to the Katusha team. \"They know how to make this boat go really well and it makes the tactician much smarter. It is always important to be quick and the guys made the boat go well. Without that, none of this happens.\"\nWith a discard kicking in following this regatta, so Igor Lah's Team CEEREF is on level points in the 2017 RC44 Championship with Katusha, but the Slovenia team leads \u2013 and is the new recipient of the golden wheels (the RC44's yellow jersey equivalent) \u2013 through having a higher result at the 2017 RC44 World Championship.\nHaving led for the duration of the four day event here, Lah was disappointed not to have won the RC44 Cascais Cup. \"We missed it for a second time by a point, so we will come back next year to try and make it third time lucky.\"\nThe 2017 RC44 Championship is set to conclude next month with the RC44 Calero Marinas Cup in Marina Arrecife, Lanzarote over 23-26 November.\nThe Royal Ocean Racing Club is pleased to announce the appointment of Christopher Stone as the new Racing Manager from mid-November 2017.

It is a trick movement that was first described by Dail (1951) when patients with poliomyelitis were observed to be gulping air into their lungs. It was this gulping action that gave the technique the name 'frog breathing'.\nGlossopharyngeal breathing is a form of positive pressure ventilation produced by the patient's voluntary muscles where boluses of air are forced into the lungs. Paralyzed patients dependent on a mechanical ventilator may be able to use GPB continuously, other than during sleep, to substitute the mechanical ventilation. The most common use of GPB is in patients who are able to breathe spontaneously but whose power to cough and clear secretions is inadequate. The technique may enable these patients to shout to attract attention and it may help to maintain or improve lung and chest wall compliance (Dail et al 1955).\nTo breathe in, a series of pumping strokes is produced by action of the lips, tongue, soft palate, pharynx and larynx. Air is held in the chest by the larynx which acts as a valve as the mouth is opened for the next gulp. Before starting to teach a patient glossopharyngeal breathing it is helpful for him to inflate his chest using an intermittent positive pressure ventilator with a mouthpiece. He can practice holding the breath while removing the mouthpiece and avoiding escape of air through the larynx or nose. The most important step in learning GPB is the up and down movement of the cricoid cartilage while keeping the jaw still. The patient can practice by watching the movement in a mirror and feeling the cartilage with his fingers.\nThis sequence should be practised slowly at first and then gradually speeded up until the movement flows. A leak of air may occur through the nose and, until it is prevented by the soft palate, a nose dip may be required.\nThe next stage is to take a maximum breath in and, while holding this breath, to add several glossopharyngeal gulps, to augment the vital capacity. When correct, the patient will feel his chest filling with air, and the physiotherapist can test the 'GPB vital capacity' by putting a mouthpiece attached to the expiratory limb of a Wright's respirometer in the patient's mouth before he exhales.\nThe respirometer can be used to measure the volume per gulp; the patient will require less effort and reach his maximum capacity more quickly if he develops a bigger volume per gulp. A study by Kelleher & Parida (1957) reported a group of patients in whom the average volume per gulp varied from 25-120 ml, and when teaching GPB an attempt should be made to achieve at least 60 ml per gulp. When used for clearance of secretions, 10-20 gulps may be required to obtain a maximal vital capacity, but if GPB is being used continuously as a substitute for normal tidal breathing approximately 6-8 gulps may be taken before breathing out.\nGlossopharyngeal breathing would normally be taught with the patient in a comfortable sitting position, but when mastered should be practiced in positions useful for the patient to clear his bronchial secretions. After filling his chest to capacity he signals to the physiotherapist who compresses his chest as he lets the air out The patient may have sufficient muscle power to apply compression himself or carers can be taught to give assistance.\nGPB is learnt easily by some patients, but others need time and patience to acquire this skill and must be motivated to practise frequently during the learning period. It is a valuable technique to consider when treating tetraplegic or poliomyelitis patients with a vital capacity of less man 2 litres. Instruction can begin when the patient has reached a stable condition, but it is inappropriate in the acute phase or during an acute chest infection. When successfully learnt it is invaluable during a period of chest infection to assist in the clearance of secretions. For a patient with a chest infection nursed in a 'tank' ventilator ('iron lung'), assisted coughing (Higgens 1966) may be more effective if the patient uses GPB to augment the inspiratory volume received from the ventilator before chest compression is applied.\nIt is possible to teach Glossopharyngeal breathing to patients with an uncuffed tracheostomy tube, provided there is an effective seal round the tube to avoid air leaks.\nGlossopharyngeal breathing should not be attempted in patients with neuromuscular disorders affecting swallowing, and, in patients with a progressive disorder, intermittent positive pressure breathing ( I P P B ) may be more appropriate than GPB. The technique is contraindicated in patients with airflow obstruction or pulmonary disease.\nFran\u00e7ois Maltais \"Glossopharyngeal-Breathing\", American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Vol. 184, No. 3 (2011), pp. 381.\nAssociation of Chartered Physiotherapists in Respiratory Care.
