        ("The route begins in the west at a junction with SH 93 roughly thirteen miles south of Boulder. From there, the road proceeds eastward into the northern portions of the Denver metropolitan area. The road passes through portions of the cities of Superior, Broomfield, Northglenn, and Westminster and crosses SH 121 before being split by a 3.8 mi (6.1 km) section of concurrency with U.S. Route 287 (US 287) and again resuming its course towards its eastern terminus at exit 223 of I-25 in the city limits of Westminster.\n\nAs of 2017 there is a brief gap of much less than a mile between the junction of SH 128 and SH 121 and the junction of SH 121 and US 287 that is not even nominally part of SH 128. This gap is due to be closed in 2018 by a mile-long connector that began construction in 2009;[2] there was a five-year hiatus from 2010 to 2015 during negotiations with BNSF.[3] When construction is complete, the total end-to-end length, including the section that is nominally concurrent with US 287, will be 14 mi (22.5 km).", "The gap between the junction of SH 128 and SH 121 is due to be closed in 2018."),

        ("On 19 September 2013, it was announced that Michael Fassbender, Kodi Smit-McPhee, and Ben Mendelsohn had joined the cast of Slow West, produced by Film4 Productions.[8] Principal photography commenced on 21 October 2013 in New Zealand, which stood in for the film's Colorado setting.[9] The flashbacks set in the Scottish Highlands were filmed in Wester Ross.[10] Maclean, who is Scottish, \"felt the scenes in Scotland had to be shot there\" and not in New Zealand.[10]\n\nThe film received critical acclaim upon its premiere at Sundance.

        ("I read Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Stop Smoking. I promise I’m not being paid for this. The comedian Paul F Tompkins smoked for years but quit after reading this book, and would recommend it to anybody who wanted to try. I’m a big fan of his, so I decided it couldn’t hurt. As soon as I started the book, I realized what it was doing. I figured I was way too smart for it and that it would never work, even though I understood the points it was making and the psychology it was using. I continued to smoke as I was reading it, as the book instructs you to do, and was absolutely sure the cute little tricks it was using would never work and that I had just wasted ten bucks. I finished the book, threw away the unsmoked half of the pack I was on, and haven’t had so much as a craving since. I don’t even vape, I’ve had absolutely no cravings and no nicotine in any way for almost ten years now. I can not explain it but it worked immediately, in a way that nothing had worked up to that point, and wholeheartedly recommend it to anybody who is serious about quitting. ETA: Worth pointing out that's it's not a magic bullet and it doesn't work for everybody. To paraphrase a reply, it seems most effective on people who have a firm commitment to quitting but just haven't been able to make it stick for whatever reason. If you've tried everything but nothing's worked and you really, truly don't want to be a smoker anymore, it's worth a shot. ETA2: I just turned off notifications for this post because I really need to go to work and I'm getting like 10 replies a minute. I'm glad so many people have experienced success with this book and that so many others are interested in it! If you have questions, just read it!", "Paul F Tompkins was a longtime smoker."),

        ("I’ll likely be downvoted for this but this is just your standard straight down the middle athlete answer during media week, if you have a problem with the answer [which is fair] then it’s less about him as an individual and more about the NFL’s media training and stance as a whole. The same journalist asked everyone else the same question on both teams and they all answered pretty much the same. They do it to create as little headlines and distractions as possible before the big game. The only reason this may get more attention despite a similar neutral answer to everyone else is because of the TS connection.

As someone who isn’t much of a fan of his or the Chiefs he’s publicly supported and advocated for causes and groups that are diametrically opposed to Trump.

        ("Unlike major foreign policy announcements with past presidents, including Mr. Trump, the notion of the United States controlling Gaza had never been part of a public discussion before Tuesday. But privately, Mr. Trump had been talking about U.S. ownership of the enclave for weeks. And his thinking had accelerated, according to two administration officials, after his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, returned from Gaza last week and described the horrific conditions there.\n\nBut nobody — not in the White House, not the Israelis — expected Mr. Trump to roll out the idea on Tuesday until shortly before he did so. The idea was met with immediate opposition from the Arab world, including from Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally. And in comments to reporters on Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt tried to soften some of Mr. Trump’s statements.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump had questioned why Palestinians would want to return to Gaza after being relocated and suggested the area could become a haven for tourists, Ms. Leavitt maintained that Mr. Trump simply wanted Jordan and Egypt to take in Palestinians “temporarily.” And she minimized the idea of U.S. financial investment, despite Mr. Trump positing a “long-term ownership” interest.", "Steve Witkoff is President Trump's Middle East envoy."),

Now, Oscar season has become a decentralized free-for-all where social-media sleuths and determined fan armies dig up past gaffes, bad tweets and damaging clips, then amplify them on X, TikTok and awards-adjacent subreddits.

The ascendance of Brazilian best-actress nominee Fernanda Torres further boosted the bedlam, as her fan base on social media went after Gascón for implying that people associated with Torres were \"tearing me and 'Emilia Pérez' down.\" Days later, it was Torres who had to apologize when online Oscar obsessives resurfaced a 2008 clip of her performing in blackface on a Brazilian comedy show.", "The Brutalist was criticized for using A.I. speech tools."),

        ("Hannibal was the son of the great Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca. The Greek historian Polybius and the Roman historian Livy are the two primary sources for his life. According to them, Hannibal was taken to Spain by his father and at an early age was made to swear eternal hostility to Rome. From the death of his father in 229/228 until his own death about 183, Hannibal’s life was one of near constant struggle against the Roman Republic. Hannibal’s earliest commands were given to him in the Carthaginian province of Spain by Hasdrubal, son-in-law and successor of Hamilcar. It is clear that Hannibal emerged as a successful officer, for, on the assassination of Hasdrubal in 221, the army proclaimed him, at age 26, its commander in chief, and the Carthaginian government quickly ratified his field appointment. Hannibal immediately turned himself to the consolidation of the Punic hold on Spain. He married a Spanish princess, Imilce, and then conquered various Spanish tribes. He fought against the Olcades and captured their capital, Althaea, and he quelled the Vaccaei in the northwest. In 221, making the seaport of Kart-hadasht (modern Cartagena, Spain) his base, he won a resounding victory over the Carpetani in the region of the Tagus River.",  "Hannibal married a Spanish princess called Imilce."),
